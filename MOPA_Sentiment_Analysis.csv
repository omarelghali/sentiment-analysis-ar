Business/investor sentiment,Abu Dhabi,"532,000 business licences were issued in the UAE by end-August.

New licence issuances across the UAE surged nine per cent in eight months this year over the same 2017 period, reflecting the steady recovery in business confidence.

According to the UAE's Ministry of Economy, a total of 532,000 business licences were issued across the Emirates by the end of August, with Dubai and Abu Dhabi accounting for 85 per cent of the total at 453,000.

While Dubai accounted for 249,000 or 46.8 per cent, in Abu Dhabi, a total of 77,406 licences were issued.

Analysts see the surge in new licence issuance despite the challenging business environment against the backdrop of general regional slowdown as a vote of confidence in the long-term UAE economic prospects and its pro-business policies and initiatives.

In 2017 World Bank Ease of Doing Business report, the UAE ranked 21st globally and first among Arab countries for the fifth year in a row.

Data from the Ministry of Economy show that in Dubai, limited liability companies account for the majority of the new licences (170,066 companies), followed by individual companies (72,807), foreign companies (2,141), single member limited liability companies (1,869), and Gulf companies (894).

In Abu Dhabi, out of the 77,406 licences, 25,460 were for limited liability companies and 17,942 for company branches.

In Sharjah, 51,998 licences were issued, of which 23,178 were for limited liability companies.

Dubai and Abu Dhabi have been initiating several stimulus measures on top of several new policy and regulatory reforms undertaken on federal level, including 10-year residency visa for certain categories as well labour guarantee refund, to stimulate business growth.

As part of a drive to encourage new businesses, the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development launched recently its expanded Tajer Abu Dhabi licence package, enabling business applications from all GCC nationals and UAE residents with an Emirati partner without an office or physical presence. The committee also abolished the need for a two-year office or workspace licence, permitting instead permanent home-based licences.

The service is part of the three-year Dh50 billion stimulus package for the emirate unveiled in June by His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.

Tajer Abu Dhabi allows new businesses to start at a much lower cost since they no longer have to invest in office space and all the associated costs. This will allow them to focus both time and money at the important early stages of their business into growth and innovation, further increasing their contribution to the economy.

Investor confidence in Dubai has been remaining strong despite several global and regional challenges on the back of a string of investor-friendly reforms and regulations initiated by the authorities.

According to various surveys, including the latest data provided by the Department of Economic Development, the competitive edge Dubai has been enjoying for years as a global hub for startups and new ventures received yet another acknowledgement with the DED data showing that the emirate clocked 24,489 transactions related to business licensing and registration in July alone.

There have been several game-changing initiatives that have improved business confidence and the long-term investment outlook of Dubai. However, the most anticipated game-changer will be the new investment law to be unveiled in the fourth quarter - which will authorise complete foreign ownership of firms in select sectors, analysts said.

The landmark decision of the UAE Cabinet to raise global investors' ownership of companies to 100 per cent and the launch of an integrated system for UAE visas aimed at attracting talents are among the critical steps that fast-track the country's efforts towards achieving the objectives of the National Agenda 2021, analysts said.

The Dubai Competitiveness Report 2018 issued by the Switzerland-based IMD World Competitiveness Centre in cooperation with the Dubai Competitiveness Office of the DED shows that the emirate ranks first in the Arab world and fourth worldwide in the 'economic performance' pillar, outpacing Canada, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong and all EU countries excluding Luxembourg.

According to the report, Dubai leads the Arab world in direct inward investment flows and tourism receipts among others. The report showed that Dubai ranked first among Arab countries and ninth globally in inward investment with 6.42 per cent of GDP and with a stock of $73.8 billion, ahead of the US, Australia, Canada, Germany, France and China. Dubai also ranked second in the Arab world and 12th globally in 'foreign direct investment abroad' with 4.51 per cent of GDP and a total stock of $28.8 billion.

Business/investor sentiment,Abu Dhabi,"The Abu Dhabi index rose on Tuesday, extending gains for another session to its highest level in more than three years, leading regional gains, on the back of buying in banking shares.

The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange general index hit a high of 4,915.35, the highest level seen since October 2014, since before closing 0.57 per cent higher to 4,911.19.

'In Abu Dhabi, the index displayed a significant increase on the back of First Abu Dhabi bank that has accomplished key milestones in the integration process of its merger, which boosted investor confidence in the financial sector as a whole, where heavyweight Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank also pulled the index up,' Issam Kassabieh, senior analyst with Menacorp, said in a morning note.

First Abu Dhabi Bank closed 1.79 per cent higher to Dh14.25. Union National Bank, Dana Gas and Waha Capital closed 0.50-1 per cent higher. Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank closed 0.7 per cent lower to Dh7.12.

'The focus now is on the real estate sector. Though there may be exceptional items that boost bottom line as a result of the real estate stimulus package, revenues are expected to take a hit and the market desperately needs to see maintained margins in order to prevent the sector from falling even further,' Kassabieh said.

The Dubai Financial Market General Index closed 0.90 per cent lower to 2,951.07. Dubai Islamic Bank fell 0.39 per cent lower to Dh5.06. Emaar Properties closed 1.21 per cent lower to Dh5.31.

Business/investor sentiment,Abu Dhabi,"Residential sale prices in Abu Dhabi declined by around one per cent in the first quarter of 2018 and by five per cent from the same period in 2017, as secondary market transactions suffered from suppressed investor sentiment, a report said.

Abu Dhabi's residential market continues to experience deflationary pressures driven by weak demand fundamentals and the cautionary approach of many occupiers, due to the uncertain employment environment, added the market analysis from CBRE, a commercial real estate services and in-vestment firm.

In the leasing market, average residential rentals have also continued to fall. However, positively the rate of decline is now lower than has been evident for much of the last three years. On a comparative year-on-year basis, rentals in the capital have dropped by around 10 per cent, but the quarterly change was around 1.6 per cent,” said Matthew Green, head of Research and Consulting at CBRE.

Key takeaways:

Residential

Despite the general downward trend in average rental rates, the emirate's housing performance has remained somewhat mixed, depicted by a range of declines between one to five per cent during the year period.

Despite the more challenging economic environment, Abu Dhabi's residential sector continued to witness an active off-plan sales market, led by a series of launches from the local developer Aldar. In 2017, Aldar is estimated to have launched close to 1,900 homes, of which 83 per cent of the units were sold by the end of the year.

Mayan, the luxury golf facing development of Aldar on Yas Island is understood to have been more than 80 per cent sold with a significant number of units purchased by UAE institutional investors.

Strong sales were also evident in the positive sales achieved by The Bridges on Reem Island and Waters Edge and West Yas developments on Yas Island.

By end 2020, the level of new supply in Abu Dhabi looks to be consistent, averaging just over 8,250 units per annum, and totalling roughly 25,000 units.

A report from the Statistics Centre Abu Dhabi (SCAD) has indicated a 7 per cent annual increase in the volume of foreign direct investment in Abu Dhabi during 2017. Sales of properties accounted for roughly 28 per cent, and were the highest contributory segment to the total FDI. Construction and building activities also grew by around 14 per cent during same period.

Hospitality

During 2017, Abu Dhabi welcomed around 4.9 million visitors, reflecting over 10 per cent growth over 2016 figures. This number is expected to expand at an even faster pace during 2018, with the Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism (DCT) forecasting annual visitor numbers of over 5.5 million.

The opening of The Louvre Abu Dhabi, along with the other leisure attractions on Yas Island, has helped to expand the Emirate's tourism offerings to both domestic and foreign visitors.

The total number of hotel guests for the month of February reached around 358,400, which translated into a 16 per cent annual increase from last year's 308,000 hotel guests.

The average hotel occupancy in Abu Dhabi reached 81 per cent in February, roughly 3 per cent higher from same period in 2017.

Despite the increase in guests and occupancy rates, RevPAR's fell by close to 21 per cent, reaching to Dh286 ($77.8)/room February 2018, driven by a 23 per cent decline in ADR's, which dropped to Dh354/room/night, as compared to circa Dh460/room/night in February 2017.

Rising hotel inventory levels and stiff competition amongst hotel properties continues to weaken the overall revenue performance.

Assuming minimal levels of delay, the total room inventory in Abu Dhabi is estimated to reach circa 37,000 keys by the end of 2020.

Offices

Abu Dhabi's commercial office market remains in a contraction phase, with take-up levels suppressed by the lack of leasing activity from the Public Sector and Oil and Gas occupiers, which form the backbone of demand in the Emir-ate.

Average prime office rentals now measure around Dh1,615/per sq m/annum, having declined 8 per cent from Dh1,750/per sq m/annum for the same period in 2017. The outlook for offices remains somewhat bleak, with further downside to rentals and occupancy expected during 2018.

Secondary office rentals now average Dh800/per sq m/annum, roughly 15 per cent lower than the achieved rentals during the first quarter of 2017.

It is now a heavily tenant led market, with occupiers benefitting from a wide array of options, with landlords willing to offer much more flexibility in their leasing terms to secure tenancies and reduce the risk of long term vacancy rates.

As the market has softened, the pace of construction has slowed, with delays in building completion and actual handover of properties aiding the situation, offsetting the negative impacts of weaker demand and avoiding further aggravation of rental levels.

Future supply levels have also declined, with limited new office projects being launched over the past five years, reflects the market's challenges. In total circa 0.5 million sq m of new office space could enter the Abu Dhabi office market during 2018 - 2020, assuming minimal delays.

Retail

Just like other asset types, the retail sector is feeling the pinch of weaker demand levels as consumers have become more prudent with their spending (both from rising cost of living and impacts of VAT).

Despite the overall weaker market sentiment, major malls continue to enjoy comparatively strong occupancy and rental levels.

During the quarter, prime rents for typical line shops (mall-based) ranged between Dh2,500 – 3,200 per sq m per annum whilst similar units within off-island locations had rents between Dh2,000 – 3,200per sq m per annum.

Although, rental ranges remain wide, average rentals decline by around 8 per cent year-on-year, with more severe declines for secondary and tertiary locations.

With retail inventory levels expanding, mall operators are now becoming more open to negotiating with tenants and have become more generous with incentives and contract terms.

Analysis of the on-going development pipeline indicates that circa 0.29 million sq m of new retail GLA is expected to be handed over in the Abu Dhabi market during 2018 – 2020. Over the next three years, total retail development is expected to reach close to 1.9 million sq m GLA. This will reflect roughly 18 per cent of the existing organized retail stock.

Overall Market Outlook

Both commercial and residential leasing markets are expected to follow similar downward trajectories as the previous year, as new supply places further pressures on rentals and occupancy rates.

However, the hospitality sector is likely to see an improving outlook, as guest nights and occupancies continue to rise. However, average room rates and overall revenues are expected to face further downside risk.

As competition tightens, further drops in average room rates are to be expected as hotels target domestic tourists with attractive promotions and discount packages. – TradeArabia News Service"

Business/investor sentiment,Dubai,"New projects and tourism activity underpin growing confidence about the Dubai economy among local businesses, according to a survey by Dubai's Department of Economic Development (DED).

Analysis

The DED's quarterly business survey, released on November 10th, suggests the emirate's private sector is witnessing robust growth, as the government rolls out initiatives to boost growth and strengthen Dubai's credentials as a regional business hub. The services sector-traditionally dominant in Dubai-is the most confident market segment, followed by manufacturing. Overall, the Business Confidence Index for Dubai moved up to 118.5 points during the third quarter of 2018 from 112.7 points in the second quarter, although this is down on 121.4 points in the third quarter of 2017.

The recent DED report indicates an overall pick-up in economic activity, with some positive effects from higher oil prices in 2018. The department's Business Registration and Licensing service issued 1,898 new licences during October 2018, an increase of 25.8% compared with September. However, Emirates NBD's Dubai Economy Tracker index -another barometer of economic sentiment-for October showed the lowest reading since March 2016, with the index falling to 52.5 from 54.4 the previous month as travel and tourism contracted marginally and the private sector continued to feel the impact of a prolonged oil price slump. Although output and new orders in the private sector were still in positive territory in October according to the Emirates NBD survey, growth rates slowed compared with previous months in 2018.

Despite a seasonal slowdown in tourism in October, we expect Dubai's economy to continue to gain momentum from increased government spending on infrastructure projects in the run-up to World Expo 2020, a positive business environment, with the opening up of a handful of sectors to 100% foreign investments, and oil prices that we expect to stay above US$70/barrel during our forecast period. However, economic growth will remain susceptible to volatility in global crude oil prices despite Dubai's economy being the least dependent on hydrocarbons among the Gulf Arab states.

Dubai ranks third globally in the number of greenfield FDI projects, according to the Financial Times ' fDi Markets, which account for 64 per cent of total FDI projects in the first half of 2018.

Sheikh Hamdan added that Dubai's ability to maintain its position as one of the top FDI destinations in the world reflects the confidence of the global investor community in its business environment and its ability to offer diversified investment opportunities in key growth sectors, especially knowledge and technology.

Business/investor sentiment,Dubai,"New licence issuances across the UAE surged nine per cent in eight months this year over the same 2017 period, reflecting the steady recovery in business confidence.

According to the UAE's Ministry of Economy, a total of 532,000 business licences were issued across the Emirates by the end of August, with Dubai and Abu Dhabi accounting for 85 per cent of the total at 453,000.

Business/investor sentiment,Dubai,"Positive sentiment for Dubai's future projects in May was the highest ever recorded by Emirates NBD's Dubai Economy Tracker Index since the gauge was launched in April 2012.

Non-oil sector conditions also improved at the fastest rate in 13 months in May, with the wholesale and retail and travel and tourism sectors driving the momentum, according to the index.

Positive sentiment towards future growth prospects reached a series-record high in May,” Emirates NBD said in a statement on Monday. New project wins, Expo 2020 and forecasts of robust demand underpinned business confidence.”

Dubai’s economy, which suffered an economic slowdown in the past few years, is expected to have stronger growth this year on the back of higher government spending, particularly expenditure related to Expo 2020 projects.

The seasonally adjusted Emirates NBD Dubai Economy Tracker Index – a composite indicator designed to give an overview of operating conditions in the non-oil private sector economy – reached 57.6 in May up from 53.9 in April, the fastest pace of growth since April 2017. A reading above 50 indicates expansion and a reading below 50 indicates contraction.

The sharp rise in the Dubai Economy Tracker index supports our view that growth in Dubai will be faster this year relative to 2017, but the headline reading masks the squeeze on profit margins which is also evident in the survey data,” Khatija Haque, head of Mena Research at Emirates NBD, Dubai’s biggest bank, said on Monday. Firms, particularly in the wholesale and retail sector, cut prices aggressively to boost their output and new orders last month.”

The wholesale and retail sector led the improvement in May, with the sectoral index reading of 58.3, up from 53.5 in April, followed by travel and tourism with 57.3, up from 55.3. The construction sector was the only one to decline - to 54.6 from 54.9 in April. ________

The uptick in business conditions in May were driven by higher rates of new output, which increased at the fastest pace in 40 months, and new order growth, which accelerated to a 39-month high thanks to promotional activities and robust” demand conditions.

New hiring in May grew at a limited pace, with many respondents saying that employment growth was restricted due to efforts to contain costs”.

For the UAE, the headline seasonally adjusted Emirates NBD UAE Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 56.5 in May, from 55.1 in April. The figure was indicative of a sharp improvement” in UAE business conditions, above the long-run average, the bank said last week.

The UAE PMI has been rising steadily since March, when it hit a 10-month low, declining to 54.8 from 55.1 in February. The May reading was the highest in four months.

Business/investor sentiment,Dubai,"Business confidence in Dubai has risen over the first quarter of 2018 and Q4 2017 as local businesses anticipate better revenues, sales volumes, orders and profits, according to a survey conducted by the Department of Economic Development (DED).

According to DED, the entity’s composite business index improved by 5.5 points after registering 116.7 points in Q1 2018, compared to 111.2 points in Q4 2017. The survey for Q1 2018 was conducted taking a sample of 502 companies across Dubai and they were asked to indicate if they anticipated an ‘increase’, ‘decrease’ or ‘no change’ on key outlook indicators, including sales revenues, selling prices, volumes sold, profits and number of employees.

In the survey, DED noted that improving global economic prospects and improving oil prices, coupled with Dubai’s investments in infrastructure, diversification and economic transformation are expected to lead to an uptick in growth from 2.8 percent in 2017 to 3.5 percent in 2018.

Across Dubai, outlooks across all the survey’s various indicators were found to have improved. Sentiments on sales revenues, for example, rose from 26 percent in Q1 2018 to 37 percent in Q2 2018, with 35 percent of respondents noting that they expect higher sales volumes, up from 22 percent for Q1 2018.

Of the sectors analysed, trade appears to be the most confidence about their business prospects in terms of revenues, selling prices, profits and new purchase orders, while the services sector is the most optimistic about hiring expectations.

In the trading, auto traders were found to be particularly optimistic about the prospects of higher sales volumes during Q2 2018.

Half of the survey’s respondents said they expected business conditions to improve in Q2 2018, compared to 41 percent the previous quarter.

Business/investor sentiment,Dubai,"The latest business confidence survey conducted by the Department of Economic Development (DED) shows that economic conditions during the first quarter of 2018 (January-March) have improved over the same quarter of last year, and also over Q4 2017. The Composite Business Confidence Index has improved by 5.5 points after registering 116.7 points in Q1 2018 as compared to 111.2 points during the same quarter of 2017.

Furthermore, the outlook for Q2 2018 appears to be even more promising as businesses are anticipating better outcomes on revenues, sales volumes, profits and new orders.

The brighter global economic prospects, coupled with strengthening oil prices and improvement in global trade are supplementing Dubai's continued investment in infrastructure, diversification, and economic transformation to a knowledge-based economy.

These developments have translated into better returns on investment and are contributing to an expected pickup in growth from 2.8 per cent in 2017 in real terms to an anticipated 3.5 per cent in 2018.

Looking ahead, the continued drive to meet Expo 2020 infrastructure needs, the easing of the fiscal adjustment in the emirate, and the recent announcements by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, of a freeze in government fees for the next three years, and new measures to boost investment and cut cost of doing business are all adding to the upbeat business sentiments.

Emirate-wide, the outlooks across all the indicators have improved.

Sales revenues

For example, sentiments on sales revenues have increased from 26 per cent for Q1 2018 to 37 per cent in Q2 2018, and 35% of respondents expect higher sales volumes, up from 22 per cent for Q1 2018.

At the sector level, the trade sector appears to be the most confident about their business prospects in terms of revenues, selling prices, profits and new purchase orders. The services sector is the most optimistic about its hiring expectations. Within the trading sector, auto traders are optimistic of higher volumes during Q2 2018 with a net balance of 75% based on higher demand. Exporters are more upbeat than domestic market-oriented firms across all the parameters in the Survey.

Half of the Survey respondents expect the business situation to improve in Q2, 2018 compared to 41% in the previous quarter. While 40 per cent of the respondents expect more stable conditions, the survey also indicates that 49 per cent of the respondents do not expect any negative factors to impact their business operations.

Trade barriers,Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The United States is not looking to grant more waivers for Iranian oil imports after the reimposition of U.S. sanctions, the U.S. special representative for Iran said on Saturday, underlining Washington's push to choke off Tehran's income.

""We are not looking to grant any waivers or exemptions to the import of Iranian crude,"" Brian Hook told a industry conference in the United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi.

Washington granted waivers to eight major buyers of Iranian oil - including China, India, Japan and South Korea - after restoring energy sanctions in November.

Hook declined to say what the administration in Washington would do when those waivers end in May.

""Iran is now increasingly feeling the economic isolation that our sanctions are imposing ... We do want to deny the regime revenues,"" Hook said.

""Eighty percent of Iran's revenues come from oil exports and this is (the) number one state sponsor of terrorism ... We want to deny this regime the money it needs,"" he added.

Tensions between Iran and the United States have increased since May, when U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers, saying the accord was flawed in Tehran's favour, and reintroduced sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the pact.

""We want a new and better deal (with Iran) but in that process we are denying the Iranian regime billions and billions of dollars and they are facing a liquidity crisis,"" Hook said.

The Islamic Republic, he added, would not return to the negotiating table without pressure.

Tehran has refused to renegotiate its nuclear accord and says its ballistic missile programme - another source of concern for Washington and its regional allies such as Israel and Saudi Arabia - is solely defensive and untouchable.

Hook said Washington was pleased with China cutting its oil imports from Iran, and that he expected much deeper reductions in Iranian oil exports. ""We are just getting started,"" he said.

Iran's crude exports will be severely curtailed for a third month in January as it struggles to find new buyers amid the sanctions, according to tanker data and industry sources.

Separately, Omani Oil Minister Mohammed bin Hamad al-Rumhi told the conference that Washington had not asked the Gulf Arab state to stop a gas pipeline project with Iran and that talks were continuing.

He said some partners for the project had pulled out because of the risk of punishment by Washington for dealing with Iran but that some other Asian firms were willing to take part.

Trade barriers,Abu Dhabi,"The Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (DED) and the General Administration of Customs announced that several industrial inputs imported by Abu Dhabi will be exempted from customs duties from January 15th, in a move designed to boost the emirate's industrial sector.

Analysis

The exempted imports include items such as raw materials, machinery, equipment and spare parts. The move forms part of the Abu Dhabi government's Dh50bn (US$13.5bn) three-year economic stimulus programme announced in 2018, which envisages non-oil sectors playing a more prominent role in driving economic growth. The new waivers will apply largely to goods headed for the emirate's industrial free zones, such as the Khalifa Industrial Zone and the Khalifa Port Free Trade Zone.

Many existing industrial imports already benefit from customs duty waivers, which amounted to about 26,000 transactions worth a total of Dh1.5bn in 2017. The exemptions will reduce costs for local manufacturers, and enhance the competitiveness of manufacturing goods in Abu Dhabi. According to the DED, 37 projects covered by industrial licences entered into production in Abu Dhabi in 2017-an 85% increase in year-on-year terms-and the recent measures to exempt certain imports from customs duties indicate that the authorities intend to support manufacturing growth.

The tax exemptions are in line with other recent measures announced by the Abu Dhabi government that exempted all new economic licences from local fees for two years (2019-20). However, the industrial import duty waivers could serve another purpose, by helping Abu Dhabi exporters to gain exemptions for their exports from US tariffs imposed in March. Abu Dhabi's industrial holding company, Senaat, which has interests in steel and aluminium, has announced plans to procure waivers from the US for its commodities businesses. Its subsidiary, Emirates Steel, has been affected by the US government's imposition of a 25% steel tariff. However, the effect of the tariffs is less marked for Abu Dhabi and the UAE economy than for major steel producers globally, as just 5% of Emirates Steel's exports go to the US. The import waivers for industrial goods will help to boost short-term economic growth, and if the UAE is able to gain exemption for steel exports (not our central scenario), this will be an additional benefit for the manufacturing sector.

Trade barriers,Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi stocks gained 0.6 per cent to 4,934 points on Monday.

Dubai - Oil price and equities markets in the GCC and Asia continued their positive momentum that began from the beginning of the year, helped by a positive outcome of the US-China trade war talks, strong US jobs data as well as dovish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

But analysts say that the coming weeks could witness heavy volatility due to concerns regarding US government shutdown, Brexit uncertainty and flat global economic growth.

On the equity front, all major Gulf markets rose for a 3rd straight session on Monday, boosted by financial stocks amid rising oil prices, while Saudi Arabia and Qatar gained sharply as most of their banks increased.

The UAE stocks continued their upward momentum in line with surge in regional markets with Dubai bourse rising 0.14 per cent to 2,534 points and Abu Dhabi gaining 0.6 per cent to 4,934 points. Among other regional markets, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul Index gained 1.4 per cent to 8,048 points; Oman's Muscat Securities Market rose 0.23 per cent to 4,312 points; Qatar's index jumped 1.4 per cent to 10,494 points; Kuwait moved up half a per cent to 5,403 points; while Bahrain remained flat at 1,331 points.

In Abu Dhabi, the UAE's largest lender First Abu Dhabi Bank climbed 1 per cent and Emirates NBD, gained 2.1 percent, helping the indices to remain in positive territory.

On Monday, oil prices gained 2 per cent with Brent trading at $58.2 per barrel. Crude price have jumped 12 per cent since last Monday as the market absorbed cuts in Opec output that came in to effect in January.

Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said financial markets are clearly extremely sensitive to US-China trade developments and this continues to be reflected in equities, crude prices and currencies.

""A sense of optimism over US-China trade talks ending on a positive note seems to be supporting risk sentiment today. However, investors could experience a rude awakening if reality fails to mirror expectations. While a breakthrough deal between both sides seems unlikely, any signs of cooperation or plans for further discussions will be a welcome development for global markets as trade tensions cool,"" Otunuga said.

However, if talks conclude on a sour note - risk aversion is poised to return with a vengeance. ""It must be kept in mind that a trade war presents a major threat to global growth and stability. Such unfavourable market conditions will place equity markets, crude prices and riskier currencies in the firing line,"" he said in a statement to Khaleej Times.

Syed Zeeshan Kazmi, deputy manager, IGI Financial Services, said crude oil price rebound may struggle on US-China trade war fears.

""The spotlight now turns to Beijing, where a delegation from Washington DC has arrived for talks meant to de-escalate the US-China trade war. Traders will be monitoring sound bites emerging from the gathering, which will run through Tuesday. Comments hinting at rapprochement are likely to lift investors' mood, pushing crude oil higher alongside shares while gold falls inversely of rising yields,"" Kazmi said.

Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, noted that many indicators have indicated a peak in the US. economic cycle, including most recent economic surveys, financial conditions, housing data, and the inversion of the US Treasury yield curve.

""Adding this together with trade tensions, political risk, fading fiscal stimulus, and a tighter US monetary policy; the economic outlook is expected to look much more vulnerable in 2019"", remarked Sayed.

Going forward, Otunuga of FXTM believes geopolitical risk factors such as Brexit-related uncertainty, heightened political risk in Europe, chaos in Washington and slowing growth momentum in China continue to weigh heavily on sentiment.

""Fears revolving around plateauing global economic growth remain a drag on equity markets while oversupply concerns and demand worries are seen punishing oil prices down the road. With a government shutdown in the US compounding uncertainty, the coming weeks for financial markets are at threat of being explosively volatile and wildly unpredictable,"" he added.

European markets retreated Monday as the focus turned to trade issues. Germany's DAX was down 0.6 per cent at 10,706 while the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares and CAC 40 in France fell 0.6 per cent each.

In US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28.01 points, or 0.12 per cent, at the open to 23,461.17. The S&P 500 opened higher by 3.67 points, or 0.14 per cent, at 2,535.61. The Nasdaq Composite gained 18.68 points, or 0.28 per cent, to 6,757.54 at the opening bell.

Trade barriers,Abu Dhabi,"Industrial inputs imported to Abu Dhabi will be immediately exempted from customs duties effective 15 January, a media report said.

Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED) and the General Administration of Customs in Abu Dhabi announced the tax waiver at a media briefing as part of a stimulus provided by ADDED to the industry sector in the emirate, reported Emirates News Agency Wam.

The exempted imports include raw material, machinery, equipment and spare parts.

Ali Al Humami, Director of the Industrial Organisation Department at the ADDED Industrial Development Bureau, and a number of officials from the General Administration of Abu Dhabi Customs announced the development.

Ali Al Humami said that immediate waiver relies upon the annual balance system of beneficiaries via direct e-connection between the systems used by the General Administration of Customs in Abu Dhabi and Industrial Development Bureau.

He said the volume of transactions pertaining to exempting industrial inputs from customs duties received by the Bureau in 2017 amounted to 26,000 transactions with a total value of Dh1.5 billion ($408 million), noting that the total amount has been waived.

Trade barriers,Abu Dhabi,"Dec. 26 -- The Industrial Development Bureau of Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development ADDED and the General Administration of Customs in Abu Dhabi have announced implementing immediate exemption of industrial imported inputs from customs duties, in terms of ""raw material, machinery, equipment and spare parts"" as part of the stimulus that ADDED provides to the industry sector in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.

This came during a media briefing held today at the headquarters of the Department with the involvement of Mr. Ali Alhumami, Director of industrial organization department at the Industrial Development Bureau, and a number of officials from the General Administration of Abu Dhabi Customs.

At the press conference, Mr. Ali Alhumami stated that the announcement of implementing immediate exemption of industrial imported inputs from customs duties responded to the agreement signed between Industrial Development Bureau of ADDED and the General Administration of Customs in Abu Dhabi, on the sidelines of Abu Dhabi Business Forum events, held recently in Abu Dhabi under the patronage of H.H. Sheikh Hazza Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Vice Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council.

Moreover, he explained that immediate exemption of industrial imported inputs from customs duties relies upon the yearly balance system of beneficiaries via direct E-connection between the systems used by General Administration of Customs in Abu Dhabi and Industrial Development Bureau.

He indicated that specialist technical group at Industrial Development Bureau examines the annual requirements of beneficiaries and identifies it within the yearly balance system used for the investor's profile via industrial licenses systems. Where the confirmation of overall materials & quantities required throughout the year as an annual balance is approved, representing a qualitative change in terms of the time taken and accuracy of procedure.

Mr. Ali Alhumami mentioned that the approval of the request for immediate customs exemption is based the findings of an integrated technical study implemented regarding annual requirements of the industry inputs for the beneficiaries, rather than reviewing each exemption request separately, by drawing on the use of one system in the technical evaluation process and reducing the time taken to approve the exemption request, to be undertaken immediately. In addition to reduce the number of technical studies, whereas the yearly balance of beneficiaries (400 to 500 requests) is examined instead of reviewing each individual request for more than 26,000 requests per year.

He reported that the volume of transactions pertaining to exempting industrial inputs from customs duties received by Industrial Development Bureau over 2017 amounted to 26,000 transactions with a total value of (1.5) billion dirhams.

Besides, Mr. Ali Alhumami indicated that the system currently used for exempting industrial inputs from customs duties is carried out immediately since submitting the request via (Dhabi system) in two steps: to provide the customs declaration, grant approval immediately and then to pay the required fees. Suggesting that the request before was carried out within one to two working days. By submitting the customs declaration, applying for the exemption request, payment of fees and activating the request on (Dhabi) system after the confirmation of fees payment, reviewing the request and then to approve or reject in the two systems and finally reviewing the request and adopting the final approval.

He added that the new system for customs exemptions is based on a single detailed study for the beneficiary, after it was requiring a separate detailed study for each request being submitted. Which helps the beneficiaries to define their requirements of imported materials for their industry inputs, while contributes to achieving easy access to statistical data electronically and accurately to implement high quality technical studies.

On his part, the General Administration of Abu Dhabi Customs underlined that the General Administration of Customs in Abu Dhabi is working efficiently to strengthen mutual cooperation frameworks with partners, intended to implement the areas in the Strategic Plan of Abu Dhabi Customs. With a view to achieve the main goals of such areas represented in making Abu Dhabi the preferred destination for import & export, facilitating trade, supporting industries and enhancing the economic growth of the Emirate.

the General Administration of Abu Dhabi Customs suggested that implementing immediate exemption of industrial imported inputs from customs duties, in terms of raw material, machinery, equipment and spare parts, would effectively contribute to reducing the cost of manufacturing on local manufacturers, thus enhancing the competitiveness of national products and supporting the economic prosperity and industrial development of the Emirate.

Abu Dhabi Customs added that The activation of the new immediate customs exemption system in (Dhabi) system will reduce the time taken for customs clearance, thus realizing the Abu Dhabi Customs message and methodology towards updating procedures and digital transformation of operations, to facilitate the import & export intended to deliver better service to customers with the highest standards of international practices.

Trade barriers,Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, UAE, Nov. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- As Chair of the Anti-Illicit Trade & Brand Protection Summit in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), David M. Luna, President and CEO, Luna Global Networks & Convergence Strategies LLC underscored how global illicit trade threatens the economic and national security of countries all around the world. Attending the Global Trade Development Week (GTDW) event on Nov. 20-21 in UAE, Mr. Luna underscored how illicit trade is a threat multiplier that can impede the international community's collective efforts to fight corruption, organized crime, and terrorism.

In attendance and providing keynotes were His Excellency Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansoori, Minister of Economy, UAE; H.E. Secretary-General Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD); Malek Hannouf, Chairman, Gulf Brand Owners Protection Group, (BPG), and Head of Intellectual Property Department, Middle East & Africa, Louis Vuitton (LV); and Tarkan Demirbas, Vice President for Middle East, Philip Morris International (PMI).

Chris Clague, Managing Editor, and Global Editorial Leader, Trade and Globalization, The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and Jeff Hardy, Director-General, Transnational Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade (TRACIT) also participated at the GTDW conference and briefed on the 2018 Global Illicit Trade Environment Index and specific policy recommendations related to the UAE market.

At the inaugural GTDW Anti-Illicit Trade workshop in Shanghai, China in July 2018, Luna Global Networks was proud to work with numerous partners from across the public and private sectors to launch an Anti-Illicit Trade Alliance, to strengthen networks and find innovative ways to help protect our economies, markets, and communities against the harms and impacts posed by the global illegal economy.

Since that time, Luna Global Networks has continued to work with many champions across regions, sectors, and industries to harness the requisite energies to strengthen cross-border cooperation to address today's fundamental transformation of illicit trade, through a network of networks where dynamic collaborations, strategic alliances, and collective action are helping to elevate the shared global resolve to more effectively combat illicit markets.

""For the reality is that no one economy or industry is immune from illicit trade and convergence crime,"" said Mr. Luna.

Numerous international organizations have estimated that today's global illicit markets, and various forms of ""convergence crime"", account for several trillions of US dollars every year, to include the trafficking of drugs, humans, arms, counterfeit and pirated goods, illegal cigarettes and alcohol products, endangered wildlife, pillaged natural resources, and many other illicit commodities, corrupt proceeds and illicit financial flows.

""This is simply a staggering amount and a menacing threat to our public health and safety,"" emphasized Mr. Luna.

Fake water (bottles) and foodstuff add a heightened public human security dimension, as do counterfeit medicines, auto parts, and other illegal fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) that are toxic and deadly.

""Of equal concern is not only the current breadth and scale of today's illicit markets, but that many of them will double within five years' time alone, and the fact that criminals are diversifying their illicit portfolio to finance other threats,"" stated Mr. Luna.

Building on the leadership and work of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and its Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade, in a 2017 report by the International Chamber of Commerce's Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy (BASCAP) and the International Trademark Association (INTA), it is projected that the global economic value of counterfeit and pirated goods alone will reach close to $3 trillion by 2022.

Internet online shopping and cybercrime also present a threat to companies and consumers alike. It is expected that the financial costs from cybercrime will double from $US 3 trillion in 2015 to $US 6 trillion by 2021.

On Free Trade Zones, Mr. Luna also emphasized that in too many parts of the world, FTZs are exploited on a daily basis by some to facilitate illicit activities that produce broader market reputational harm and put the physical security of many communities in danger.

""The UAE has taken many positive steps to fight illicit trade,"" said TRACIT Director-General Jeffrey Hardy during his GTDW presentation. ""But persisting vulnerabilities in the country's Free Trade Zones--including Jebel Ali, the world's 9th the world's ninth busiest container port--undermine achievements to date.""

On illicit cigarettes, with the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (the ""Protocol"") taking effect earlier this year, Mr. Luna encouraged countries to sign and ratify the Protocol to address the cross-border challenges posed today by illicit networks and to commit to be part of a global enforcement regime to tackle the illegal tobacco trade globally.

Reinforcing the keynote by Minister Al Mansoori that new UAE laws will help to fight fraud and illicit trade, Mr. Luna stressed that ""we can also learn from our UAE partners from their economic policies that promote innovation to modern and smart policing and enforcement that are innovative such as the UAE approach to cybercrime as Interpol Secretary Jurgen Stock underscored a few days ago in Dubai.""

""Through such collaborative efforts including here this week in the Abu Dhabi, we can do more together to combat illicit trade at all levels across global security landscapes.""

David M. Luna, a former U.S. diplomat and national security official, is the new chair of the Anti-Illicit Trade (AIT) Committee of the United States Council for International Business (USCIB) and is currently a Senior Fellow for National Security at the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center, Schar School of Policy and Government, George Mason University. He was previously also the President (Chair) of the OECD TFCIT; Chair of the APEC Anti-Corruption and Transparency (ACT) Working Group and APEC U.S. Coordinator for the ACT Pathfinder Initiative on Fighting Corruption and Illicit Trade; and Vice-Chair of the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council's Illicit Trade and Organized Crime group.

Trade barriers,Abu Dhabi,"Chinese propane dehydrogenation plant operator Wanhua Chemical Group has signed a 10-year FOB term contract with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. to import 1 million mt/year of LPG, the companies said.

The ADNOC-Wanhua contract announced Sunday underpinned the commitment of Chinese importers to secure Middle Eastern supply amid the ongoing US-China trade war, in which higher tariffs imposed by Beijing have slowed inflows of US LPG.

The price of the contract or the split between propane and butane of each cargo were not disclosed. The contract will start from 2019.

""We have a strategic partnership with ADNOC and this long-term deal perfectly reflects our relationship,"" a Wanhua official told S&P Global Platts.

""Through this long-term supply agreement, we look forward to strengthening our strategic partnership with ADNOC,"" Wanhua Chemical Executive Vice President Kou Guangwusaid in the statement.

""We will continue working on potential collaborations between our companies, either in China or in the UAE, to add more value to the 'One Belt One Road' project.""

Other deals

Oriental Energy, another Chinese PDH plant operator, last month inked its first term contract with Qatar Petroleum for 600,000 mt of LPG supply over 2019, and Chinese sources noted then the deal could herald more Middle Eastern contracts with other Chinese importers.

The Wanhua official added: ""We keep working with other partners like Saudi Aramco, KPC and QP and surely renewed our term contracts with them, as well.""

Late last year, Wanhua concluded annual term contract negotiations with Aramco, KPC, QP and Abu Dhabi for FOB cargoes for 2018, a source familiar with the matter said, adding Wanhua had kept volumes for its 2018 Middle East FOB program largely steady from 2017 totals.

These included more than 20 mixed propane/butane cargoes in total, mostly evenly split between the two products. The contracts were based on the monthly Saudi Aramco contract prices for propane and butane, the source said.

The source added Wanhua would import around 2.3 million mt of LPG in 2017, up 64% year on year, with a focus on increasing imports from the Middle East.

ADNOC said the state-run company produces 10.5 million mt/year of LPG. It is expanding its refining and chemical capabilities via investments with partners worth up to $45 billion over the next five years, including plans to build the world's largest integrated refinery by 2025.

""Investors are reacting to the positive news of the potential merger of ADCB and UNB and possibly Al Hilal Bank,"" said Tariq Qaqish, managing director of the asset-management division at Mena Corp. Financial Services in Dubai.

""The banking sector globally is moving towards digital, therefore closing branches, focusing on cost to income ratios is vital for banks to compete and be able to generate higher returns on equity. The UAE is no different.""

Dubai-based Arqaam Capital said it saw 40 percent upside for UNB from Monday's closing price of 3.86 dirhams a share, according to a note to clients.

Arqaam added it saw ADCB as the consolidator in the transaction and that a merger would give the combination a higher index representation on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.

ADCB stocks surged 12.8 percent to eight dirhams a share, the highest since August 2015. UNB jumped 14.8 percent to 4.43 dirhams, the highest since March this year.

Middle East stock markets were mostly muted on Tuesday on concerns that trade disputes involving the United States could hurt the global economy.

""The unpredictability of the U.S. trade policies towards global trade partners is affecting investors' appetite towards equity markets,"" Qaqish said.

The Saudi Tadawul All-Share Index was up 0.3 percent, showing muted interest from investors after they priced in the incorporation of Saudi shares into MSCI's Emerging Market benchmark next year.

Shares in Saudi Real Estate Co jumped 6.6 percent to 14.72 riyals in its heaviest trade since May after the company said it had signed a framework agreement with the Presidency of State Security, which combines counterterrorism and domestic intelligence services, to provide ""end-to-end delivery"" for all the agency's projects in over 100 locations.

In Kuwait, bluechip stocks such as National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) and Agility were boosted by expectations for inflows into those stocks when the country begins to join the FTSE Russel emerging markets index on Sept. 24.

Trade barriers,Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi: Sultan Bin Saeed Al Mansouri, Minister of Economy, said on Tuesday the tariff issue relating to aluminium and steel could be resolved next year as talks continue with the US.

US President Donald Trump earlier this year announced import tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium, and negotiations have been going on between the US and the UAE to resolve the matter.

“We will continue to go and explain our case because it is a very strong case. When it comes to the bilateral trade it is in favour of the US highly,” he said speaking to reporters on the sidelines of anti-illicit trade and brand protection summit in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.

“At the end of day the main question was whether there was any imbalance of trade between the US and other nations. This is where they took action, but for us, this is in favour of the US so we don’t see any reason why we have been slapped with this 10 per cent (tariff).”

The UAE is the third-largest exporter of aluminium to the United States, after China and Russia. It also exported 290,221 metric tonnes of steel to the US in 2017, according to figures by the US Department of Commerce.

Al Mansouri said he held discussions with the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during his visit to Washington in June this year.

“He promised [US commerce secretary] us they are going to look into the issue.”

Speaking on other aspects of the UAE’s economy, Al Mansouri said the new foreign direct investment law, which came into effect last month will strengthen the legislative system and will boost the investment environment.

“We anticipate investments in the UAE to grow from 15 to 20 per cent in 2019. The new law is a pivotal step in the UAE’s efforts to strengthen the legislative system in the country.”

Al Mansouri also said trade volumes have been growing due to prudent policies and targeted growth plans.

“The value of non-oil foreign trade in the UAE in 2017, including free trade, amounted to Dh1.612 trillion ($439 billion), of which Dh979 billion ($267 billion) were for imports and Dh443 billion ($121 billion) for re-exports.”

“UAE’s non-oil exports grew substantially in 2017, reaching Dh190 billion ($52 billion) compared to Dh60 billion ($16.5 billion) a decade ago.”

On illicit trade, he said governments and businesses are losing billions of dollars due to trade in counterfeit products and the UAE, as a strong re-exports hub, could become affected by commercial fraud and harmful trade practices.

“In order to better combat fraudulent trade practices, the new Federal Law No 19 of 2016 was implemented to suppress fraud and contain deception in commercial transactions. This law introduces significantly more hefty penalties to combat fraud, including fraud relating to intellectual property.”

The decision was announced on Tuesday after the 12th session of the India-UAE Joint Commission Meeting (JCM) for Economic and Technical Cooperation, which was held on 3-4 December in Abu Dhabi.

The countries signed an agreement on a currency swap between the Reserve Bank of India and the Central Bank of the UAE. According to the agreement, two countries can make payments in their national currencies — Indian rupees and Emirati dirhams (AED), avoiding the involvement of a third currency, which is designed to boost bilateral trade.

""It is also expected to give a push for the local currencies of the two nations and may reduce the impact of volatility in exchange rate arising from the dependency on a third currency. It is also expected to reduce the transmission costs arising from exchange rate risk"".

In April 2018 during the 2018 Dubai Global Convention key experts attended a meeting predicting that the two countries' bilateral trade would exceed $100 billion by 2020. Abdulla Al Saleh, Under Secretary of Foreign Trade and Industry at the UAE Ministry of Economy noted that ""India is the first trading partner for the UAE"", saying that $35 billion in bilateral trade (of $53 billion) is non-oil related.

In November 2018 discussions on establishing a national currency trade mechanism were held between India and Russia. The representatives from Russian banks (including Vnesheconombank, Sberbank, and VTB) attended the meeting organised by the Indian Banks' Association (IBA), according to the Hindu Business Line. 

India earlier signed a currency swap agreement with Japan, known as a Bilateral Swap Arrangement (BSA) worth $75 billion.

Trade barriers,Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi: Illicit trade is growing and the response through multilateral trade institutions such as World Trade Organisation will help in combating the problem, a senior official from Dubai government said.

“Illicit trade is a global issue and its breadth and scale are growing,” said Raed Safadi, chief economic adviser, office of the director-general, Government of Dubai while speaking at the The Economist Events’ Global Illicit Trade Summit in Abu Dhabi.

“Illicit networks exploit the technological, financial and communication innovations of globalisation. The international response through multilateral trade institutions such as the World Trade Organisation will help combat illicit trade.”He also said there should be a holistic approach to deal with the issue.

“The focus should not be on a few categories, but on all categories of illicit trade. Then a serious conversation needs to start with the WTO.”

The event held at Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi brought together delegates and prominent experts from the government, law enforcement agencies and private sector to address the root causes of illicit trade and ways to combat it.

Michael Morantz, policy analyst, illicit and counterfeit trade, from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), highlighted that free trade zones (FTZ) represent a significant economic opportunity but also pose heightened risks from illicit trade.

A recent OECD report on the ‘Trade in Counterfeit Goods and Free Trade Zones’ for example, finds that the presence of an additional FTZ on a given territory is associated with a 5.9 per cent increase in the value of trade in counterfeit goods from the host economy.

“From this data that the OECD has produced on FTZs, it is clear we need more accountability and better transparency for Free Trade Zones. The OECD is working on developing guidance on FTZs with its member countries and partners through the Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade, which it hopes can help strengthen resilience of zones.”

Trade barriers,Dubai,"Dubai, Feb 10 (EFE).- The World Government Summit in Dubai, attended by more than 4,000 delegates from 140 countries representing the business, cultural and political sectors, on Sunday featured speeches and discussions of peace, development and the present and future world economy.

The conference, organized annually by the government of the United Arab Emirates, included key international figures such as International Monetary Fund general director Christine Lagarde, several heads of state and assorted Nobel Prizewinners.

In the inaugural address of the conclave, Lagarde warned that the world economy is growing more slowly than anticipated because of various factors.

Key among those factors, Lagarde said, are trade tensions, tax hikes, financial restrictions, the uncertainty over Brexit and the deceleration of the Chinese economy.

In her speech, the IMF director laid out her vision of the future of the world economy, which - she emphasized - finds itself at a moment of ""transformation.""

Lagarde said that many jobs will change ""radically"" as a consequence of globalization and new technologies, noting that many jobs will be adapted to ""artificial intelligence.""

She also took advantage of her time at the speaker's podium to issue a call to all countries to fight against corruption, emphasizing that it creates a lack of confidence and puts the brakes on economic growth.

Less convinced about the positive effects of technology on the organization of labor was Nobel Prizewinner in Economics Paul Krugman.

The US economist emphasized that technology has changed a great deal in the past 25 years, but that has not meant much shift in the way people work, and so - in his judgment - the tech revolution has not been a truly ""revolutionary"" kind of change and the expected shifts in the workplace have not been as great as had been anticipated.

Pope Francis, who just wrapped up a trip to the UAE, also participated in the summit via a video message sent to the forum attendees reminding them that ""one cannot speak of sustainable development without solidarity.""

Via a video, the pontiff asked the attendees - in taking up ""basic issues"" like the challenges of politics and economic development - not to simply ask themselves what the best opportunities are to take advantage of, but rather ""what kind of world we want to build together.""

""We could also say that the good, if it is not common, is not true good. Perhaps now more than ever thinking and acting requires real dialogue with others, because without others there's no future for me,"" he said.

Peace and conflict were also among the issues discussed at the forum.

Former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, in his remarks in a panel on the issue, discussed the peace process that he led in his country emphasizing that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrillas had to be treated as ""adversaries, not as enemies.""

""The most important thing is to convince the other party, especially the commanders, that for them personally it's better to negotiate peace than to remain at war,"" he said.

Some heads of government took advantage of the forum to call attention to their countries, with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan appealing to foreign investors to back his country at a time when his government has undertaken a series of reforms that he admitted have been ""painful.""

It is time for investors to come to Pakistan, Khan told the audience, which included many multinational business leaders.

At the plenary session, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri talked about incorporating women into the labor forces and positions of responsibility in his country.

Hariri said that not involving women and not training them to work in all sectors represents a ""great loss"" for a country's GDP.

Also speaking on Sunday at the forum were Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas and French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire.

The conference, which has been held in Dubai each year since 2012, is scheduled to wrap up on Tuesday."
Trade barriers,Dubai,"Confidence in the Middle East’s economy grew in Q4 2018 even as overall regional sentiment weakened amidoil price[https://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-50354-oil-price-hike-unlikely-to-spur-gcc-construction-growth] reductions, andglobal economicconfidence hitanall-time low”.

The Association of Chartered Certified Accounts (ACCA) and the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) revealed these findings from their jointly implemented Global Economic Conditions Survey (GECS), which attracted 3,773 responses from their members around the world. Of the total number, 302 respondents are chief financial officers, both organisations said.

There remains the risk of an escalation in protectionism, predominantly driven by a trade war between the US and China.

According to the survey’s findings, the overall negative confidence measure in the Middle East is fairly well correlated with oil prices”, and is reflective of the global economic sentiment.

The UAE’s economy was seen as being likely to perform relatively strongly” over the next 12 months, even though oil price volatility may be observed during the period. However, as the report explained, the country’s strong fundamentals ensure that its fiscal policy will not require a dramatic tightening.

Significantly, the UAE’s spending on infrastructure projects[https://www.constructionweekonline.com/168489-infrastructure-takes-major-cut-in-dubai-budget-ahead-of-expo-2020], particularly in support of Expo 2020 Dubai[https://www.constructionweekonline.com/projects-tenders/168709-expo-construction-to-fuel-uaes-4-economic-growth], will underpin growth” in the year to come.

Indeed, it is notable that despite a dip in overall confidence, there was a sharp improvement in the government spending [index],” GECS stated.

Commenting on the UAE market in an interview with state news agency,Wam, Hanadi Khalife, director for Middle East, Africa, and India operations at IMA, said: The results of the survey show increasing business confidence in the Middle East, which has been stimulated by UAE’s spending on its infrastructure.

Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate in the UAE over the next few years, affected by the non-stop construction activities ahead of Expo 2020 Dubai. Estimates show that infrastructure investments are playing a key role in driving the growth of the local economy that is increasingly relying on non-oil activities,” Khalife added, according to theWam report published late in January 2019.

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s economy[https://www.constructionweekonline.com/business/168641-construction-companies-in-saudi-arabia-will-see-growth-in-2019] is likely to weaken” in the next 12 months, according to the survey. Production cuts by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) are seen as being a critical factor for the kingdom’s economy[http://www.apple.com], where monetary policy is likely to be tightened further”.

The fall in oil prices is likely to lead to a decline in government revenues, and government spending will need to be cut to offset lower revenues,” GECS continued.

Non-oil earnings of $33.9bn contributed 12% to Saudi Arabia’s total revenue[https://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-50992-saudi-crown-prince-commends-765bn-non-oil-revenue-in-2018] in 2014. This number grew by 32% to $76.5bn in 2018, with the surge largely attributed to the continued implementation of economic reforms[https://www.constructionweekonline.com/business/169146-economic-reforms-to-benefit-builders-in-saudi-arabia]”, value-added tax (VAT[https://www.constructionweekonline.com/business/169133-what-will-vats-effect-be-on-ppp-construction-projects-in-the-gcc]), and energy price reforms, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Finance, Mohammed Al-Jadaan, said in December 2018.

There remains the risk of an escalation in protectionism, predominantly driven by a trade war between the US and China.

In 2019, overall growth in the global economy is expected to fall short of recent years”, when it has averaged 3.5%. The US and Eurozone are both expected to slow down this year, and the outlook for the UK is extremely uncertain”, in part due to Brexit.

Emerging markets, especially those with a greater export dependence, are vulnerable to a slowdown in the wider global economy, the survey stated, adding: There remains the risk of an escalation in protectionism[https://www.constructionweekonline.com/168797-saudi-arabia-ceos-provide-2019-industry-outlook-technological-disruption-ai-construction-real-estate], predominantly driven by a trade war between the US and China. Other risks include Chinese bank failures, a ‘no-deal’ Brexit, and a prolonged shutdown of the US Government.

With China slowing too in the near term, the world’s largest economies are losing momentum. Elsewhere, there is the prospect of faster growth, in some cases generated by economic reforms, particularly in Latin America and Africa. We look for global growth to hold up above 3% this year,” GECS added.

Trade barriers,Dubai,"Dubai: The head of DP World reiterated on Sunday that he expected 2019 to be a “challenging year,” adding that the company is taking a “cautious approach” towards its costs.

Sultan Ahmad Bin Sulayem, chairman of Nasdaq Dubai-listed DP World, said that events such as the UK’s exit from the European Union (Brexit) and trade tensions between the US and China heighten uncertainty and confuse investors. He said he was not concerned about trade tensions, however, as he believes they will end.

“The United States and China [are] two giant economies, and both need each other. They’re negotiating. In my opinion, all these threats are part of the negotiations, and they will come to an agreement,” the chairman said at a press conference in Dubai.

“Until they come to an agreement, they have created uncertainty in the market… I don’t take [trade tensions] as something negative. I think it is something to take notice of, to watch, and be aware of,” he added.

Bin Sulayem’s comments are a reiteration of his statements from late 2018 when he said there is “general caution in the market given the current uncertainty in global trade,” highlighting the challenges that such uncertainty creates.

On Sunday, the chairman said he expected trade tensions between the US and China, which have both imposed tariffs on products worth billions of dollars from each other, to end. He also pointed that DP World’s concessions for ports in other countries tend to be for around 50 years, so the company’s approach is a long-term one.

Discussing other challenges this year including Brexit, Bin Sulayem said DP World has already calculated a worse-case scenario for Brexit, and is more concerned about the lack of clarity regarding the direction the UK is heading. The company operates a port and free zone in London.

“In my opinion, the indecisiveness of the government — ‘yes, we’ll do it, no, we won’t’ — is what confuses investors. We don’t know if [Brexit is] going to happen with an agreement, or without an agreement, or if they’re going to renegotiate, or if the [political] party will be supportive or not… and that’s what hurts the market the most,” he said.

Bin Sulayem was speaking at an event to discuss the results of a recent report by the Boston Consulting Group on the economic impact of DP World’s Jebel Ali Port and Jebel Ali Free Zone.

The report said the port and the free zone accounted for 33.4 per cent of Dubai’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 10.7 per cent of the UAE’s GDP in 2017. It added that the port and the free zone contributed 16.2 per cent of Dubai’s employment.

In 2018, DP World invested Dh1 billion into the expansion and growth of both Jebel Ali Port and the free zone, with plans to invest Dh500 million into the port and free zone this year.

Trade barriers,Dubai,"The UAE economy is expected to expand 3 per cent in 2018 despite headwinds in the global economy, trade war concerns and volatility in oil prices.

(Reuters file)

Non-oil growth in the UAE will expand further in 2019 and 2020 on the back of fiscal stimulus and fast-track preparations for Expo 2020 Dubai, and the momentum is also expected to strengthen further in the coming years, the International Monetary Fund said in its latest note.

The global financial institution has predicted that the non-oil sector will grow faster in 2019 than the oil sector despite some recovery in crude prices.

""Non-oil growth is projected to rise to 3.9 per cent in 2019 and 4.2 per cent in 2020. The oil sector's prospects have also improved with higher oil prices and output. Overall real GDP growth is projected at around 3.7 per cent for 2019-20,"" the IMF said on Saturday.

""The contribution from the private sector is projected to rise owing to, among other things, the recently-announced reforms, continued recovery in private sector credit growth, and stronger consumption growth,"" Hazem Beblawi, the IMF's executive director for the UAE, said in the note.

Following the slowdown in 2015-16 due to a decline in crude prices, the UAE economy is recovering and ""growth momentum is expected to strengthen in the next few years with increased investment and private sector credit, improved prospects in trading partners, and a boost to tourism from Expo 2020"", it added.

The Abu Dhabi government announced a Dh50 billion stimulus package in May 2018 to support its economic development with an aim to accelerate the economy over the next three years. This augments the Dubai government's planned investment of $6 billion for Expo 2020 in 2018-20, mainly for airport and Metro expansions and site developments.

""As private sector activity picks up and stimulus measures are phased out, fiscal consolidation is expected to resume, to ensure sufficient saving of oil wealth for future generations. The overall fiscal balance is projected to turn to a surplus next year on higher oil prices and remain positive over the medium term,"" IMF analysts said.

Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansouri, UAE Minister of Economy, said at an aviation summit recently that he expected the economy to expand 3 per cent in 2018 despite headwinds in the global economy, trade war concerns and volatility in oil prices.

""Growth should be around 3 per cent [for 2018]. It is positive considering we see a lot of challenges in the global economy with all the protectionism. The fluctuation in oil prices did have an effect but [only] to a certain extent and, because the UAE is a diversified economy and oil contributes roughly about 30 per cent of GDP, the effect of oil was minimum,"" Al Mansouri said while addressing a forum in Dubai last week.

Atik Munshi, senior partner at Crowe, said non-oil sectors will mainly boost the UAE economy for 2019.

""We are on the threshold of Expo 2020, which provides the positive sentiment to the market. Rents and other overheads of doing business in the UAE have come done in these last few years, which will help businesses perform better if market size is sustained. 2018 has been a tough year for most businesses in the UAE, though 2019 is expected to be better,"" Munshi added.

He said getting better credit facilities from banks for small and medium enterprises sector is one factor that will still pose a challenge in 2019. ""Market-size enhancement could be the other challenge faced by the economy.""

The IMF said the UAE's real GDP will grow 2.9 per cent for 2018 and 3.7 per cent for this year. It predicted real oil GDP to grow 3.1 per cent in 2019 while real non-oil GDP will expand 3.9 per cent.

It foresees GDP growing from $432.6 billion in 2018 to $455.5 billion this year and $475 billion in 2020. It predicts a shortfall of Dh26.1 billion for 2018 with revenues at Dh448.5 billion and expenditures at $474.6 billion. It sees a Dh30.5 billion surplus for 2019 with revenues at Dh528.8 billion and expenditures at Dh498.3 billion. For 2020, it predicts revenues at Dh515.1 billion and expenditures at Dh510.7 billion.

For the UAE, it forecasts an average crude export price of $72.3 per barrel in 2019 compared to $71.9 last year.

IMF analysts commended UAE authorities for introducing value-added tax and stepping up structural reforms, plus the upgrading of its prudential framework.

Analysts stressed on the importance of increasing supervisory vigilance and strengthening management of contingent liabilities from borrowing by government-related enterprises, government guarantees and public-private partnerships.

Notwithstanding the UAE's already high rankings on business environment indicators, IMF analysts called for further reduction in the costs of starting, expanding and closing a business - especially for SMEs - in order to boost private sector development.

Trade barriers,Dubai,"Protectionist policies can only work as a temporary measure and are not in line with the ideology that has established Dubai as a global business hub, Hamad Buamim, president and CEO of Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI), told Arabian Business[https://www.arabianbusiness.com/politics-economics/411347-protectionism-not-in-line-with-dubais-global-business-hub-status-says-buamim].

[node:story_0]

In September last year, Mohamed Alabbar, the chairman of Emaar Properties and founder of retail platform Noon.com, called for new legislation that imposes 51 percent local ownership of e-commerce-related businesses, ranging from payment service firms to logistics companies, in order to protect the national economy from global giants such as Amazon.

This is a big question [and] we are still discussing it in the chamber,” Buamim said during an interview, when asked what he thought of Alabbar's stance.

But I am a strong believer in globalisation. Protectionism is only a temporary measure. You cannot fight it. The Internet is so big that if you do that people will find their ways around it.”

Advantages

Alabbar said that foreign companies pose a danger to the UAE’s national economy. Referring to international players like Amazon as a threat” to the local market, the Emirati billionaire said that the UAE should follow in China’s footsteps in protecting its national economy by retaining ownership.

However, Buamim said he believes that the entry of companies like Amazon into the market bring advantages too and upholds Dubai's status as a global business hub.

I believe that Dubai is a big business hub, trading hub, logistics hub and I believe Dubai can benefit from these big players,” Buamim. From one side it drives us to compete, but from the other side as well.

[node:story_1]

For example, Amazon will not ship their goods from wherever they are in the world. They need a place to distribute. I'm aware Amazon is building huge investments in Dubai. They will be recruiting tens of thousands of people.”

While the US and Europe are known for imposing protectionism, especially in certain sectors like agriculture, steel and manufacturing, Buamim said the approach is not sustainable”.

I know [that] whoever is calling for these measures - they just want it temporarily so we can build-up our own capabilities,” he said.

[But] I'd rather that we keep it as a playing field and we try to allow the big players. If you are a global city, you have to play with the global rules. I don't see protectionism as Dubai. I don't think the leadership of Dubai will buy it, frankly speaking. It's not what we stand for.”

Alabbar earlier also pointed out as an example that China has taken many measures to ensure that its economy is protected from foreign interference, such as enforcing regulations that ensure that Chinese companies or individuals have at least 51% ownership of e-commerce websites’ payment systems. Noon's competitor, Dubai-based Souq.com, was acquired by Amazon in July last year for $580 million.

However, Buamim said he believes there is enough space for everyone to operate successfully.

Trade barriers,Dubai,"Around the world – and partly because of US President Donald Trump – economic headlines have been dominated by the debate over protectionism and what role governments should play in shielding a nation’s domestic industries from foreign competition by taxing imports. In the UAE and across the Gulf, this has prompted a question: can local players make their mark without a protectionist environment?

Among those who have come out in favour of protectionism in the UAE – at least in a particular sector – is Mohamed Alabbar, the chairman of Emaar Properties and founder of Noon.com, who in September last year called for legislation that enforces 51 percent local ownership of all e-commerce related businesses.

Speaking to the Arabic-language Al Khaleej newspaper, Alabbar said that the UAE should look east to China, for an example. China has taken many measures to ensure that its economy is protected from foreign interference,” he said, further highlighting the government’s regulations that ensure majority Chinese ownership of e-commerce websites, thus forcing many foreign firms to set up local information centres.

Calling foreign companies a danger” to the local economy, Alabbar called for Emiratis to be legally guaranteed 51 percent possession of e-commerce and logistics companies, as well as the same share of e-commerce financial transactions and payment systems. Additionally, he called for global firms to be legally mandated to set up designated centres within the country to keep sensitive data in the UAE’s hands and under its control.

What’s the government say?

Although focused on the e-commerce sector, Alabbar’s comments stand in stark contrast to that of high-level government officials in the UAE, who have expressed a commitment to economic liberalisation, which they say, in turn, will help attract investment and opportunities to the emirates at a time in which it is striving to cement its role as a global business hub.

We do not believe protectionism is good for growth in any economy,” said Abdullah Al Saleh, the undersecretary for foreign affairs at the UAE Ministry of Economy. An open economy is the best policy for attracting investments, so increasing and creating competitiveness, and it’s better for future development plans.”

Even stronger words against protectionism have come from Hamad Buamim, president and CEO of Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI). While acknowledging that many countries – most notably the United States, which in 2018 announced tariffs on $50-$60bn worth of imports from China – have imposed tariffs, Buamim argues that such moves are temporary” solutions to economic woes.

I know [that] whoever is calling for these measures – they just want it temporarily so we can build-up our own capabilities,” he said in a recent interview with Arabian Business. I’d rather that we keep it as a playing field and we try to allow the big players. If you are a global city, you have to play with global rules. I don’t see protectionism in Dubai. I don’t think the leadership of Dubai will buy it, frankly speaking. It’s not what we stand for,” he said.

Moreover, Buamim said that the emirate of Dubai could benefit from the entry of large international companies, who, once established in the UAE, could potentially create significant numbers of employment opportunities for UAE nationals and local residents.

Dubai can benefit from these big players,” he said.

From one side it drives us to compete, but from the other side as well. For example, Amazon will not ship their goods from wherever they are in the world. They need a place to distribute. I’m aware Amazon is building huge investments in Dubai. They will be recruiting tens of thousands of people,” Buamim added.

A global issue

Whether or not protectionism is adopted through formal policies in the UAE or elsewhere, the country may likely still feel the effects of similar measures being taken place elsewhere around the world. In a cautious December memo, for example, the European Central Bank said that it expects the global economy will slow down as mounting protectionism has the adverse effect of curbing growth amid uncertainties about trade relations in the future.

Similarly, much of the world’s trade will likely face the consequences of protectionism in the United States, which EU Ambassador to the World Trade Organisation Marc Vanheukelen recently said was causing a deep crisis” in the world’s multilateral trading system and causing limitations on the US procurement market through Trump’s Buy American” legislation.

Trade barriers,Dubai,"Shifting trade patterns and the rise of anti-globalisation sentiment are just few key trends that businesses around the world will continue to watch in 2019 as they navigate headwinds and look for new growth opportunities.

Although political uncertainty and US-China tensions may continue to hang over the global economy, there is still reason to be optimistic about the changing global trade landscape. The new NAFTA replacement agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada is a positive development that would boost confidence in global markets once it is officially ratified by all three trade partners.

Innovative and disruptive technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence are transforming global trade and commerce as they boost efficiency of cross-border transactions and eliminate trade barriers. We are closely watching these global trends as we look for new ways to meet the evolving needs of Dubai’s maturing business community. As we enter the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is clear that the only constant is change.

Businesses that fail to adapt face the risk of falling behind and losing their competitive edge. In the UAE, the outlook looks bright with the IMF forecasting GDP growth in the country to rise from 2.9 percent in 2018 to 3.7 percent in 2019, outpacing growth projections for the Middle East and North Africa.

Strategic development plans and infrastructure projects related to Expo 2020 and higher oil prices will likely fuel this upward trend. Dubai’s rising role in global trade is reflected in the emirate’s non-oil foreign trade for the first nine months of 2018 which reached AED965bn ($262bn).

The stimulus plan and other pro-business reforms unveiled in Dubai over the last year were important developments that will not only facilitate trade, but also enhance the emirate’s reputation as an attractive investment destination.

We plan to attract more Indian companies to Dubai that can contribute to Dubai’s economic growth

We expect to see the positive effects of these proactive measures felt within the business community in the near future. The shift in economic power from the West to the East – a trend we have observed for some time – is expected to continue in 2019 with China and India serving as main engines that are increasingly accounting for a larger share of global growth.

Many emerging markets in Latin America and Africa still offer untapped potential, especially in key sectors where countries are looking to expand infrastructure, privatise and attract foreign investment. These regions are a major focus of Dubai Chamber’s international expansion strategy, due to their strong economic indicators, such as a rising middle class and increased consumer spending. Dubai Chamber’s network of international offices across Africa and Latin America are focusing their efforts on identifying business opportunities in these markets that offer the most potential for our members. At the same time, we are working to build relationships with key public and private stakeholders, attract foreign companies to Dubai and promote the emirate as a global gateway.

We are committed to providing businesses of all sizes with access to new opportunities

We are seeing growing interest among business communities in emerging markets that are keen to learn more about Dubai and the competitive advantages that the emirate offers. Evidence of this trend can be seen in high number of international delegations we are receiving at Dubai Chamber, as well as stronger participation in the Global Business Forum series, our flagship event platform that aims to expand economic cooperation between Dubai and promising markets across Latin America, Africa and the CIS region.

For the first time ever, we will be hosting the Global Business Forum on Latin America outside of the UAE in 2019 as we bring the international event to Panama City.

We look forward to leveraging this opportunity to capitalise on growing interest in Dubai and pave the way for new economic partnerships that support the objectives of the Dubai Plan 2021.

With Expo 2020 fast approaching, Dubai will soon be stepping into the spotlight and showcasing its brand, economic model and vision for the future to a global audience of 25 million visitors. International outreach and forging new economic partnerships will be paramount to this process as the emirate writes a new chapter in its success story.

Trade barriers,Dubai,"Beirut -- DUBAI: Dubai's ruler has resisted efforts by Kuwait to release nearly $500 million in frozen funds at the heart of a money laundering probe straining relations between the two Gulf allies, according to correspondence seen by Reuters.

The investigation is taking place as the United Arab Emirates tightens financial regulations to fight a perception among some foreign investors that it is a hot spot for illicit money flows owing to its free trade zones and proximity to Iran, the target of U.S. sanctions.

The frozen funds belong in part to the Kuwait government and have been frozen at Dubai's state-owned Noor Bank since late 2017, when the emirate's public prosecutor, in collaboration with Kuwait's prosecutors, started probing the lawfulness of their transfer to Dubai from the Philippines.

Executives involved deny wrongdoing.

""I am fully confident the joint efforts of Kuwait's Public Prosecutor Office and Dubai's Public Prosecutor Office will result in fair solutions to this case and utilize the legal system to address damages incurred by shareholders,"" Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum said in a letter dated Nov. 3.

He was responding to a letter sent by Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber al-Mubarak al-Hamad al-Sabah in September asking for help to release the funds.

""In light of the severe damages to government agencies and other investors due to the continued freeze on these funds, we ask your highness to direct your relevant entities to swiftly release the funds,"" Sheikh Jaber had written.

Reuters obtained a copy of both letters.

The correspondence is the latest twist in a case between two of the richest countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council.

The $496 million in question belong to Port Fund, a Cayman Islands-registered fund that is part of a Kuwaiti private equity group. Two government entities, Kuwait's port authority and the country's pension fund, had invested in the fund and are owed around $200 million.

Kuwait's prosecutors have charged two Port Fund directors for allegedly embezzling funds that the Kuwait Port Authority and the Public Institution for Social Security had invested in Port Fund. The executives deny that.

A spokeswoman for the Dubai government said: ""UAE judicial authorities are awaiting a final judgment from Kuwaiti courts on the funds frozen in Dubai to transfer them back to Kuwait based on international standard laws and procedures.""

The office of Kuwait's prime minister did not respond to a request for comment on Kuwait's demands and on the content of the letter sent in September.

Kuwait had followed up that letter a month later with a renewed request from the attorney general to his counterpart in Dubai, which detailed how the funds should be distributed to the Kuwaiti government entities, as reported by Reuters last month.

The money was frozen at the behest of the UAE central bank in November 2017 to determine if the funds sent from a bank in the Philippines to an account of Port Link, which manages Port Fund, constituted money laundering.

U.S.-based law firm Crowell and Moring, which represents Port Fund, told Reuters the money was a legitimate payment after Port Fund sold its investments in the Philippines.

Trade barriers,Dubai,"In order to develop and elevate trade ties between Ho Chi Minh City in particular and Vietnam in general with Dubai - UAE (the United Arab Emirates), Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Ho Chi Minh City Branch (VCCI-HCM) cooperated with MIG Company and Relam - Dubai to open the Dubai - Vietnam Trade Forum.

Delivering the opening keynote to the Forum, Mr Tran Ngoc Liem, Deputy Director of VCCI - HCM, said that Dubai - UAE is one of key markets in the Middle East and Africa Trade Promotion and Development Project backed by the Government of Vietnam. Vietnam - UAE trade relations have grown quite well in recent years, featured by the trade value climbing 35 folds in 12 years, from US$140 million in 2006 to more than US$5.6 billion in 2017. Particularly, Vietnam mainly runs a trade surplus with the UAE market. In 2017, Vietnam exported over US$5 billion worth of goods to the UAE while spending just US$6 million on imports from the Middle East country.

While asserting that Dubai - UAE is a key market for HCM City's trade expansion with Middle East countries, Ms Cao Thi Phi Van, Deputy Director of the Trade and Investment Promotion Centre of Ho Chi Minh City (ITPC), admitted that Dubai - UAE is ranked 43rd among 100 countries and territories investing in HCM City with just nearly US$10 million in 11 projects. Particularly in trade, HCM City’s export turnover to the UAE is very modest, just nearly US$300 million, a very small pie in the US$5 billion export value of Vietnam to that country. This shows that both HCM City and Dubai - UAE are yet to unlock their potential. Moreover, UAE states are not included in ITPC’s investment promotion programmes in the previous years.

“Realising that the cooperation potential between Dubai and HCM City has not been tapped effectively due to operations of trade promotion agencies, ITPC recently organised two business delegations to the UAE in March and late October 2018, led by HCM City People’s Committee Chairman Nguyen Thanh Phong. The city government wants to see stronger investment cooperation ties with Dubai - UAE, or particularly raising the investment value of this partner in the city,” she stressed.

Sharing about Vietnam - Dubai cooperation prospects, Mr Ashraf A.Mahate, Head of Export Market Intelligence at Dubai Exports, said, in 2017, a company bought up to 20 per cent of Vietnam's pepper output for sale in Dubai central markets, showing Vietnamese companies can go to Dubai to do business. Currently, Dubai's main exports are jewellery, pearls, gemstones and metals (accounting for 51.5 per cent). Moreover, Dubai has the world's lowest tariffs and exempt corporate income tax. This is a great advantage for Vietnamese enterprises to invest in this potential market.

He recommended that, “To export goods to Dubai - UAE more easily, Vietnamese businesses should combine offline and online channels. Firstly, they should go to Dubai to meet with Dubai Exports and we will help them figure out appropriate trade promotion plans. Then, they should open a showroom or a branch office or a representative office in Dubai to enjoy more attractive tax incentives and financial supports. Later, they should register sales booths on the online trading platform T-HUB. Like Dubai Exports, T-HUB will help Vietnamese businesses find suitable trading partners. Importantly, T-HUB will provide comprehensive support for administrative, logistics and financial procedures.” (Vietnam Business Forum – November 20)

Hosted by the UAE’s Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, CLIX is a key sustainability innovation platform within the ‘Youth 4 Sustainability’ (Y4S) hub which, along with Space, is one of the seven core pillars embedded in WFES (World Future Energy Summit), a key enablers of ADSW.

The importance attached by the UAE Space Agency to feeding its innovations back into terrestrial adaptations has already been demonstrated by its agreement earlier this year with Krypto Labs, an Abu Dhabi-based innovation hub and incubator, to facilitate the development of a ""GeoTech"" Innovation Program designed to enable several local start-ups to transform their innovative ideas into commercially viable and scalable market-ready products.

By supporting budding innovators in urban and rural land management, disaster and crisis management, and coastal border security, the scheme serves a local capacity-building function that showcases the space sector’s ability to inspire tangible innovation on earth.

As one of the must-attend events of WFES, CLIX will provide a dynamic marketplace of innovation involving over 3,000 attendees, with a special focus on Sustainability in Space, Future of Energy, and Future of Food and Agriculture that culminates in demonstrations from 48 start-ups and pre-start-ups selected as finalists from an intensely competitive field.

By providing such a productive forum for the commercialization of such dynamic creativity, WFES is aligning itself with industry trends that emphasize the key inputs of new start-ups in space tech.

A recent report by Bryce Space and Technology, a leading analytic consulting firm for space and satellite, cyber, and R&D clients, details the vanguard role played by start-ups in accelerating space investment through a range of seed, venture, and private equity finance.

According to Bryce, which is also acting as a supporter of CLIX along with WIPO and the Solar Impulse Foundation, start-up space ventures have attracted over US$18.4 billion of investment since 2000, with a clear upward trend in the investment rate evident over the past two years.

""Through our support for CLIX, Bryce welcomes the opportunity to help encourage space industry startups to showcase their innovations at a globally prominent platform,"" according to Mike French, Senior Vice President of Commercial Space at Bryce Space and Technology.

""We are delighted to support this exciting and inspiring event and look forward to the critical role ADSW can play in bringing together innovators with stakeholders committed to realizing the full promise of space-derived tech to impact our lives into the future.""

Entrepreneurs,Abu Dhabi,"2019 will be the year we see regional sovereign wealth funds investing in tech startups in the region.

This will be deployed mostly via venture capital (VC) firms, but some will also go directly into startups. Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are taking the lead – think Mubadala, Public Investment Fund and Small & Medium Enterprises General Authority (SMEA) in Saudi Arabia, Oman technology fund and Central Bank of Jordan in partnership with the World Bank.

In Egypt, there are already two new funds, Sawari Ventures and Algebra, each receiving investment from development finance institutions (DFIs) including the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the UK-based CDC and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).

Moreover, for the first time, three leading Egyptian banks will also invest, while global funds will continue to look for investments and acquisitions of regional companies which are more mature and have already scaled in several geographies, especially in Saudi Arabia.

The $120m investment by New York-based General Atlantic in Property Finder and Amazon’s acquisition of Souq is a validation that Western funds will only invest in size and scale. It is also proof that this region is investable, at least when it comes to technology. So global funds or strategic investors will not shy away from investing, regardless of the political climate.

2019-2020 will be the year of exits, and funds will start returning money to investors

In Lebanon, the central bank’s $400m ‘circular 331’ initiative to support tech start ups has run its course. We are all anxious to see the results in the coming three years. This can be assessed by the number of funds and companies it created, as well as the returns it gave to investors.

This means the success and sustainability of these startups, and ultimately their exits. So only through returns will the model be validated, since the limited partners were banks whose main drive is to make money. The ecosystem flourished when the circular was active in funding. Now, sustainability is to be tested.

Furthermore, 2019-2020 will be the year of exits. Some will be large but I predict most will be small.

Exits, however, will take place, and funds will finally start returning money to investors, encouraging new ones to believe and invest more in the region. The Careem-Uber story will continue to make headlines, while the battle for e-commerce and the Noon, Souq/Amazon war will continue with a vengeance.

We will see new products, improved services and lower prices, with the consumer being the biggest beneficiary. This battle for e-commerce will also lead to some consolidation of smaller vertical players, where traditional retail regional groups will acquire smaller e-commerce players and continue to invest aggressively. Majid Al Futtaim and Al Tayer Group are likely to lead the way.

As for rising stars to look out for in 2019, they include smaller, specialised companies such as Mumzworld, Jamalon and Yallacompare.

When it comes to fintech, central banks are finding it fashionable to launch fintech sandboxes. While regulators know they must become more digitally-savvy, the region needs to move from sandboxes to high-streets, with licensing available to everyone. This will solve problems related to peer-to-peer lending, payment solutions and digital wallets.

As for cryptocurrencies, despite the decline and crashing of cryptocurrencies globally, 2019 will see crypto exchanges finally be licensed, with Bahrain and Abu Dhabi taking the lead.

The battle for e-commerce will lead to the acquisition of smaller players

Another trend we will see is a rise in mobility for the masses. Cairo is showing the rest of the region how to solve mobility challenges in congested cities. Tuk-tuks are already in fashion in Cairo through Halan, whil Swvl provides mass/bus transportation.

Careem and Uber have also invested in similar solutions. Dubai, on the other hand, will lead the region in introducing scooters. Saudi Arabia will see startups expand to the country, but Saudi nationals will also build their own startups and scale them inside the kingdom. The biggest economy of the region is already showing some serious startup traction revolving around e-commerce, last mile delivery and mobility.

The Saudi market is quickly opening up, with new regulations easing the setting up of wholly-owned foreign companies. Then there is the last mile war, where logistics companies are popping up in every corner of the region.

The home delivery demand for groceries, restaurants and e-commerce is so huge that none of the current players are able to fulfil it. So, incumbents like Aramex are investing, and new last mile companies are popping up by the tens.

This is also spilling over to the supply chain, especially to cross-border trucking. As the e-commerce and on-demand economy accelerates, traditional supply chain providers will begin facing serious challenges, and new disruptive entrants looking to fill the gap and/or deliver logistics solutions will need to do so with deeper tech integration.

Entrepreneurs,Abu Dhabi,"Key investors in SoftBank Group Corp.'s giant tech fund have balked at a planned $16 billion investment in co-working startup WeWork Cos., leaving SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son to find an alternative as his ambitions hit up against the limits of his financial firepower.

Government-backed funds in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, according to people familiar with the matter, have told SoftBank executives they have concerns about the firms' SoftBank's negotiations to buy a majority of money-losing WeWork, whose industrial-chic workspaces and short-term leases have made it one of the world's hottest startups.

SoftBank's Vision Fund is already a major investor in WeWork after acquiring nearly a fifth of the company last year with an investment of $4.4 billion at a valuation of $20 billion. SoftBank subsequently committed another $4 billion, including a $3 billion commitment last month at a $45 billion valuation. The new investment would value WeWork at around $36 billion, the people said, and would bring SoftBank and its affiliates' total investment in the company to more than $24 billion.

Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, or PIF, and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Co. contributed the bulk of the nearly $100 billion raised by the SoftBank Vision Fund. Their size gives them an effective veto over certain investments and a loud voice in validating Mr. Son's moves.

The pushback against the new WeWork deal is unusual for the freewheeling Mr. Son, who typically gets to invest as he pleases. The 61-year-old executive has transformed SoftBank from a stodgy Japanese cellphone provider into one of the most influential technology investors in the world, bending investors to a vision based more on instinct than traditional financial analysis.

Some of the people said that PIF and Mubadala have questioned the wisdom of doubling down on WeWork, and have cast doubt on its rich valuation. The company is on track to lose around $2 billion this year, and the funds have expressed concern that WeWork's model could leave it exposed if the economy turns down, some of the people said.

PIF and Mubadala are both heavily invested in real estate, and have told SoftBank executives they would prefer the fund stick to technology bets, some of the people said.

The deal under discussion would include $10 billion from SoftBank to buy out most existing outside shareholders, plus $6 billion in new capital for WeWork over the next three years, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal would leave WeWork Chief Executive Adam Neumann with control of the company, one person said. The companies hope to announce the deal early next year, though it could still fall apart.

Mr. Son still hopes the sovereign funds will let the Vision Fund pay for some of the deal, one of the people said. SoftBank is considering other ways to fund the deal, including using its own cash, raising debt and bringing in outside investors, the person said. It may use the proceeds from the initial public offering of its Japanese telecom business.

SoftBank already carries heavy debt: nearly 18 trillion yen, or roughly $158 billion, as of Sept. 30

Mr. Son, who has backed other startups including Uber Technologies Inc. and Indian e-commerce company Flipkart, has occasionally encountered skepticism from his investors and board members.

The pushback from Mubadala and Saudi Arabia's PIF shows Mr. Son is testing his most enthusiastic backers. It also raises questions about the broader risk appetite of investors who have thrown money at fast-growing startups, no matter how unprofitable.

Under the deal being discussed, SoftBank would buy out existing investors at a valuation of around $22 billion. The additional money put into the company would come in $2 billion chunks in each of the next three years at a higher valuation, the people said. The Wall Street Journal first reported the WeWork talks in October.

Beyond its massive size, the prospective deal would be unusual in that it would leave Mr. Neumann in control of WeWork despite the fact that SoftBank would own most of the company and provide the new capital. Mr. Neumann controls WeWork's board, and his shares give him 10 times as many votes as other investors' shares, according to company filings. As of last year, he controlled a limited liability company that owned 30% of WeWork.

WeWork has spent years marketing itself like a tech company, and Mr. Neumann has compared it to Amazon.com Inc., saying that office space is to WeWork what books were to Amazon: just the beginning.

Some analysts say it more closely resembles an old-school office-leasing company, and have warned that if demand for office space and rent prices fall, WeWork could be stuck with fixed-rent leases for 10 to 15 years. WeWork took in $1.2 billion in revenue in the first nine months of the year, but spent twice as much, posting a $1.2 billion net loss. The deal talks come at a turbulent time for SoftBank and Saudi Arabia, which committed $45 billion to the Vision Fund.

Entrepreneurs,Abu Dhabi,"AMMAN — His Majesty King Abdullah and Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, on Tuesday attended the signing ceremony of an agreement between the Khalifa Fund for Enterprise Development and the Crown Prince Foundation (CPF).

The agreement aims at supporting creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship and development projects in the Kingdom, according to a Royal Court statement.

Under the agreement, the fund presents up to $100 million to the CPF, through several payments, to be given as soft loans for entrepreneurs, start-ups and their micro-, small- and medium-sized development projects, in a bid to enable entrepreneurship schemes to contribute to boosting the national economy and realise socioeconomic development.

The deal with the CPF comes in light of the foundation’s targeting of thousands of young people across the Kingdom and its keenness on developing the youth’s capabilities to better serve their communities, the statement said.

The CPF’s strategy focuses on three main pillars: skills, innovation and entrepreneurship; leadership and youth excellence; and giving and community service.

The agreement was signed by Fund Chairman Hussain Jassim Al Nowais and CPF Chairman of the Board of Trustees Fawwaz Zou’bi.

Following the signing ceremony, Nowais said that the deal highlights the deep-rooted brotherly ties” between the UAE and Jordan, stressing that Sheikh Mohammad always underlined the importance of supporting the Kingdom and enabling it to build a strong base for a diverse and sustainable economy that can contribute to more prosperity.

He added that the loan aims at supporting efforts geared towards addressing poverty and unemployment as well as enhancing women’s roles in the development process through providing them with opportunities to realise their aspirations and establish their own projects to enhance national economy revenues.

The fund chairman also said that the assistance aims at contributing to the development of rural areas and underprivileged regions across the Kingdom.

Nowais pointed out that the agreement targets some 22,000 projects over five years, expecting these schemes to provide approximately 28,000 permanent jobs for Jordanian young people, in addition to its indirect positive impact on the national economy in general.

He said that the agreement allocated 47 per cent of the total support to women, while rural areas and underprivileged regions’ share was set at 40 per cent, expecting the start of disbursing payments soon after concluding all legal procedures in both countries.

For his part, Zu’bi commended the support the UAE presents to the Kingdom in all fields, especially on the economic and development levels.

He stressed that the agreement is an important step forward in further expanding cooperation with the UAE through the fund, which is considered a regional and international pioneering institution in the fields of promoting and enhancing entrepreneurship.

Zu’bi expected this development loan to contribute to enhancing government efforts aimed at funding economic institutions that can support and enhance the economic stability of the Kingdom in the next phase, and address poverty and unemployment.

He said that the loan has several development dimensions whose positive effects can be seen within five years, especially since the loan has soft conditions and high flexibility for repayment.

Khalifa Fund was established in June 2007, as an independent, not-for-profit small and medium enterprises (SMEs) socioeconomic development agency by the government of Abu Dhabi, according to their website.

Since 2014, Khalifa Fund started expanding its horizon and replicating its model in several regional and international countries to develop SME sectors to be the catalysts for economic growth in these countries,” the website says.

The CPF was established under special law that was endorsed in 2015 to implement HRH Crown Prince Hussein’s vision towards building a bright future for Jordan’s youth by inspiring and driving their engagement to improve community well-being in three main aspects: Innovation and entrepreneurship; leadership and participation; giving and community

Entrepreneurs,Abu Dhabi,"The Ford Motor Company Fund recently marked the completion of its fifth Henry Ford Entrepreneurship Academy (HFEA) workshop in the UAE, with the Higher Colleges of Technology’s (HCT) Abu Dhabi Women’s campus hosting the programme. The HFEA has previously launched successful workshops in Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, and two in Dubai, with the inaugural installment in the capital marking the fourth emirate to date.

The continued partnership between Ford and the HCT, the UAE’s largest applied higher education institution, further strengthens the Ford Motor Company Fund’s long-standing commitment to empowering the youth by providing better opportunities through education.

The number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the UAE has been growing at a rapid pace, and there’s been a 10 per cent growth since 2016,” said Simonetta Verdi, Director, Government and Community Relations, Ford Middle East and Africa.

In fact, SMEs comprise 95 per cent of businesses in the country[https://www.thenational.ae/uae/meet-the-young-arab-entrepreneurs-paving-the-way-for-region-s-future-1.693816], which stresses the importance of providing innovative opportunities for the next generation of business leaders in the UAE.

A business-oriented and highly-focused approach to learning, assisted by training and opportunities generated by the Henry Ford Entrepreneurship Academy workshops can help participants gain important entrepreneurial skills, generate innovative ideas, and become more prepared for the future,” Verdi added.

Dr Abdullatif Al Shamsi, HCT President & CEO, said: Encouraging our students to become entrepreneurs and providing them with the right mindset, skills and toolkit is a core element of the HCT 2.0 strategy. We are embedding entrepreneurship and innovation in our academic programs to enable students to hone their skills and knowledge in these fields to successfully transit from student to entrepreneur.""

Students selected to participate in the HFEA had the opportunity to shape their thinking and learn how to build their future businesses using best international practices. HCT expects to host further HFEA workshops across its system to allow many more of our students to consider setting up their own ventures, Dr. Al Shamsi added.

Aspiring entrepreneurs in the Middle East could be considered to be among some of the most connected thinkers in the world, with the region’s young, tech-savvy population contributing to the UAE outperforming the likes of Japan and Singapore[https://www.thenational.ae/business/economy/what-is-needed-to-ignite-the-region-s-entrepreneurial-ecosystem-1.771947]* thanks to its high-quality entrepreneurship ecosystems. The HFEA is designed to help enhance the potential of budding entrepreneurs in the UAE.

The three-day HFEA workshop, entitled The Entrepreneurship Journey”, has been drawn up to complement the work undertaken by the UAE government, which continues to create initiatives to empower the youth to innovate, contributing to the welfare of the wider UAE community.

Taking place at HCT’s Abu Dhabi Women’s campus, over three days (October 29-31), the HFEA saw the 32 participants compete to best demonstrate entrepreneurial capacity, during a pitch competition. The top honour went to third-year Electrical Engineering Technology student Maitha Al Hosani, who was awarded a much sought-after in-depth consultancy from a premier US-based start-up strategy firm. Al Hosani’s business idea is for a fire alarm for people with a hearing impairment or vision issues, and for heavy sleepers. The system intends to alert those in need via a strobe light, buzzers, or with an innovative vibration pillow. In addition to the consultancy prize, Al Hosani was presented with a certificate, trophy, and awarded a brand-new iPhone.

Ford, HCT and the VCU have formed an exceptional partnership to address local entrepreneurship training needs, and remain committed to arming the successful businesspeople of the future with the skills and acumen to thrive. Through business-specific education, guidance and networking opportunities, such as the HFEA, the region’s young entrepreneurs will be better equipped to handle future challenges in the business world.

Entrepreneurs,Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Investment Co. is leading a new $60 million investment round in logistics software startup Turvo, backing a technology that Mubadala says could support its businesses in the semiconductor, mining, energy and other sectors.

Mubadala Ventures, the firm’s San Francisco-based venture-capital arm, is joining G2VP and Siemens AG-backed Next47 in the Series B funding round, and Mubadala Ventures leader Ibrahim Ajami, is joining Turvo’s board of directors, Turvo said in announcing the new backing Thursday.

Mr. Ajami said Mubadala Ventures invests in startups “using software, enabled by cloud computing and mobile, to look at archaic or difficult-to-change industries.” Supply chain and logistics is one of those industries, he said in an interview, and “we can leverage all of Mubadala’s companies around the world…by connecting these unique, innovative technologies with our global asset base.”

Turvo’s software seeks to connect wide segments of corporate supply chains, including transportation management to freight booking, payments, tracking and communications. Through a web browser or mobile device, the system looks similar to social-media applications, with shipments that can be commented on or updated in real-time by shippers, carriers or through internet-enabled sensors on vehicles.

“Logistics is inherently social—you’re working together, you’re sharing, you’re collaborating,” said Eric Gilmore, founder and chief executive of Turvo, Sunnyvale, Calif. “So why is it not as easy to share a shipment just like you’d share a photo on Facebook?”

Turvo’s use of social-media principles to increase collaboration and visibility in goods movement comes as many logistics businesses have started using consumer devices to power their operations. With higher shipping demand putting more stress on distribution networks, the use of familiar technology has sped up worker training and improved productivity, companies say.

But building an entirely new system connecting so many different supply chain functions is ambitious, and many in the growing field of logistics technology startups have tackled just one component, such as freight booking.

“More and more, it’s not just about moving things from point A to point B, but providing a significant level of transparency and collaboration across the entire supply chain,” Mr. Ajami said.

The new backing follows a $25 million Series A funding round announced in March 2017. Turvo declined to disclose the valuation of the business based on that and the new funding round.

Entrepreneurs,Abu Dhabi,"This week, startup Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (otherwise known as HyperloopTT) announced that it would start building a commercial Hyperloop track as well as an ""XO Square Innovation Center"" and a ""Hyperloop Experience Center"" in Abu Dhabi, capitol city of the United Arab Emirates. Construction will commence in the third quarter of 2019, HyperloopTT claimed.

The news seems to extend an agreement made public in April. That`s when HyperloopTT and a state-controlled real-estate developer announced the acquisition of a construction site where a six-mile (10km) commercial track would be built from Abu Dhabi, with the hopes of reaching Dubai.

HyperloopTT and its competing startup, Virgin Hyperloop One, have attracted $31.2 million and $196.2 million in investment, respectively. Both startups regularly conduct feasibility studies for hyperloop systems in locations across the globe, and they announce agreements with governments eager to cash in on hyperloop`s theoretical potential.

But neither startup has publicly demonstrated a speed record, and technical details from either company on how their 720 mile-per-hour levitating train would handle curves and braking when filled with passengers are slim. Hyperloop TT is also still building its first test track in Toulouse, France. Virgin Hyperloop One has a test track in Nevada, but little news from that track has been shared in recent months.

Earlier this month, HyperloopTT announced a prototype of a commercial passenger pod, covered in sensors to enhance safety (although the effectiveness of the pod or its sensors is still to be determined).

For this new project in Abu Dhabi, HyperloopTT received an investment from international design group Dar Al-Handasah, which will help build the HyperloopTT commercial track and peripheral buildings. Dar Al-Handasah will rely on architecture, engineering, and cost-management firms from the US, Spain, and the UK. HyperloopTT is unique in that it was started as more-or-less a volunteer effort by engineers and scientists around the world.

Virgin Hyperloop One has a competing agreement to build a test track in neighboring Dubai, which is the most populous city in the UAE. In 2016, that startup said it would have a ""Kitty Hawk"" demonstration in 2017, and its promotional materials projected a functional Hyperloop by 2020. Such a demonstration did not occur in 2017, and it`s unclear if Virgin Hyperloop One will keep its ""fully functional"" date promise.

Entrepreneurs,Abu Dhabi,"DUBAI, 13th October, 2018 (WAM) -- The Catalyst, a startup accelerator initiative between Masdar (Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company) and the international energy company BP, is seeking more UAE-based startups eligible for its next cycle of funding, training and mentorship at GITEX on October 14-18.

Since its relaunch at Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week in January, the Catalyst has selected three start-ups to receive investment and hands-on business support over a period of up to six months.

The three local startups in the accelerator’s first cycle are Solva Technologies, a logistics management platform using proprietary technology for last-mile and express deliveries carried out by fully electric motorcycles; BonApp, a mobile application designed to reduce food waste by allowing consumers to purchase fresh but unsold food produce from restaurants at a discount; and De L’Arta, a company specializing in sustainable soil regeneration techniques as well as natural skincare products extracted from UAE native plants.

""Our aim is to help build a robust start-up ecosystem focused on sustainability in the UAE, and as the potential of Solva Technologies, BonnApp and De L’Arta indicate, there are plenty of opportunities to be had in a region known for its youthful energy and entrepreneurial spirit,"" said Cinar Kurra, Chief Executive Officer of the Catalyst. ""Not only does the Catalyst offer the financial backing and industry know-how of two globally respected energy companies, it is also providing promising start-ups a home at Masdar City, Abu Dhabi’s rapidly growing clean-tech cluster and business free zone.""Today more than 560 companies operate at Masdar City, including start-ups, SMEs and multinational companies.

The move is expected to increase app subscriptions above 10,000 and further expand its food and beverage partners, which now total over 250.

Solva Technologies, which is receiving US$130,000, recently completed a successful road test of its software-optimised electric motorbikes. Meanwhile, De L’Arta, which has been allocated US$50,000 in funding, is in talks with local restaurants to source natural raw materials for its soil enhancement products.

The Catalyst accepts applications from both local and international entrepreneurs whose start-up projects in either aggrotech, biotech, electric mobility, energy efficiency systems, or food waste management systems have already reached the commercialisation stage. The accelerator provides up to US$150,000 in grant funding per company, as well as training, one-on-one mentorship, and access to the support of the award-winning Masdar City Free Zone.

Her Highness stated that entrepreneurship is a vital resource for the national economy, and highlighted that the UAE has around 23,000 female entrepreneurs who own investments and projects worth approximately AED 50 billion.

Hessa Buhumaid, Minister of Community Development, who launched several initiatives that focus on education and economic stability for women of various age groups. For instance, the Ministry’s ‘Qelada’ initiative bolsters the skills of People of Determination, offering them a steady income, while also enhancing their self-reliance and independence, thereby making a sustainable social and economic impact.

Lagarde was also informed of the work of Dr. Manal Taryam, CEO of Noor Dubai Foundation, who has contributed to changing the lives of millions who suffer from vision impairment around the world.

The UAE continues to strengthen its position as a hub for fintech startups as the country is home to highest number of startups and investments into this nascent sector, thanks to government support and initiatives taken by the financial free zones in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence, the UAE is home to the highest number of fintech startups at 67 followed by 44 in Turkey, 30 each in Jordan and Lebanon. While South Africa leads in Africa with 184 startups followed by 146 in Nigeria, 111 in Kenya, 36 in Ghana, 34 in Egypt and 24 in Uganda.

Bloomberg Intelligence sees need for more venture capital to fund growing fintech startups. The number of fintech startups and investments into this sector will continue to rise in the coming years, increasing from 96 in 2019 to 465 by 2022 in the Middle East, while investments will increase from $287 million in 2019 to $2.28 billion by 2022, according to Accenture analysis based on CBI Insights data.

""Strong momentum will start from 2019. Even though the UAE showed a fast growing number of fintech startups, the level of investment in the region is still modest. In more than $90 billion by 2017 invested in fintech startups globally since 2010, only 1 per cent was allocated to companies in the Middle East and Africa,"" the report said.

""Fintech friendly regulatory environment, government support and higher level of funding are supporting the UAE in its journey,"" said Edmond Christou, GCC financials analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.

Citing example, he said Dubai Financial Services Authority introduced in 2017 an innovation-testing licence, allowing fintech firms to develop concepts without being subject to full regulations. Also, Abu Dhabi's Financial Services Regulatory Authority set up in 2016 a regulatory laboratory with a legislative framework, which was the first of its kind in the region to support innovators.

Commenting on what the UAE can do more to expedite the growth, Christou said there should be a policy that continues to support innovation to keep up with the pace of technological changes and its risk, an environment that attracts talents and allows banks and insurers to prove the value and applicability of these technologies to the market.

Arif Amiri, CEO, Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) Authority, said DIFC's ecosystem continues to attract fintech startups with its unique experimental licences, market leading pricing and collaborative workspaces.

""We are committed to supporting this ecosystem by strengthening our international partnership network. Just last year, we have signed over 10 fintech-related MoUs that have strengthened our partnerships with other global fintech hubs, such as New York, London, Paris, Singapore, among others. In addition, our very own home-grown initiatives, such as FinTech Hive at DIFC and the DIFC's $100 million FinTech startups fund continue to play a crucial role in shaping the future of the financial landscape in the MEASA region,"" Amiri said.

The centre offers dedicated commercial licenses for fintech, regtech and insurtech firms, an interactive and collaborative workspace as well as access to the region's largest financial community - all available for entrepreneurs looking to set up and operate from Dubai.

Commenting on the growth prospects, Amiri said DIFC's fintech ecosystem of over 80 fintech-related companies, 34 of which are active registered companies in the fields of fintech, insurtech and regtech, is testament to the growing demand and interest in this disruptive sector.

""In 2018, applications for the second cohort of FinTech Hive at DIFC tripled, while the number of partners that are committed to the programme doubled. This continued growth is testament to a healthy sector that is well on its way to transform and dictate the future of finance,"" he added.

Khalid Saad, CEO, Bahrain FinTech Bay, said regional market for the fintech industry is small but potential is huge.

""When people tell me that Bahrain, Dubai and Abu Dhabi are competing with each other, I say, no, that is the wrong way of looking at things. It is not a zero-sum game. The market is still small in the region and currently the opportunities are huge and it requires a lot of collaboration. We have started expand collaboration and partnered with the DIFC FinTech Hive and ADGM. We are working with them to explore different avenues which we could collaborate and help fintech firms access different markets across the border,"" Saad said during a recent meeting.

Commenting on potentially creating a fintech unicorn from the Gulf region, he pointed out that it would require a company to expand way beyond the GCC to hit the potentially unicorn status.

""There are quite a few fintech unicorns globally, so why not one from the region as well in the next 5 years. I think investments to flow in fintech regionally and are expected to quadruple in the next 5 years. I hope more smart money has started to flow into the region and that should help make the next unicorn,"" Saad added.

Fintech's first wave centered on payments while the second wave focuses on mobile and online banking by offering less costly, faster and better user-experiences. Fintech's third wave has started to emerge with some banks adopting blockchain technology, startups growing in fields like insurance, regulation, risk solution and identity verification (KYC).

Not just conventional, the UAE is leading in Islamic fintech startups as well in the Middle East. Globally, Indonesia has the highest number of Islamic fintech startups, followed by the US, the UAE and the UK, according to DinarStandard analysis.

Furthermore, the GovTech initiative will see the UAE host the $100,000 GovHack Series – and the final at that – for the first time, with the winning start-up innovation announced on the last day at the summit.

Organized annually in line with the smart government vision of High Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, the GovTech Prize seeks to motivate government entities, startups and students around the world to pioneer technological solutions to common global challenges.

A part of the upcoming seventh edition of the World Government Summit (WGS 2019), set to run at Madinat Jumeirah from February 10 to 12, the overarching GovTech Prize initiative will host the Best m-Government Service Award and the big prize money GovHack Series final.

The Best m-Government Service Award aims to encourage government institutions to provide innovative solutions through smartphone apps. Submissions fall into seven categories, each seeking to address a specific digital challenge faced by governments. The categories include: Data-driven Apps, Harnessing Smart Technology, Public Empowerment, Gamification, Innovative Service, Public Private Partnership and Accessible Government. This year's categories have been developed in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

In its sixth edition, this year's Best m-Government Service Award has attracted a record number of submissions – 4,646 from 87 countries. The smartphone apps entered for consideration include a range of creative technological solutions to leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), accountability-building platforms that empower citizens to combat corruption, and performance management programs that standardize municipal reporting and service tracking. Altogether, the submissions demonstrate how investments in emerging technologies enables governments to provide better, smarter, and more integrated services that improve citizens' lives.

Mohammad Bin Taliah, assistant director general for Government Services Sector at the Prime Minister's Office in the Ministry of Cabinet Affairs and the Future, said: Harnessing technological innovation is essential to develop better methods of tackling the challenges that will arise in our shared future. Every year, the GovTech Prize recognizes the best smart government initiatives as part of the UAE's global mission to contribute to positive and inclusive change in our world through supporting innovation.”

$100,000 GovHack Prize Money

This year is also a groundbreaking year for the GovHack Series: it will mark the first time the event has been hosted in the UAE. Running from July 2018 through January 2019, the GovHack Series is a worldwide event hosted across five cities, where start-up participants solve issues that face governments worldwide with innovative start-up ideas. The various fields they seek to address include: governance and resilience, economy and society, environment and health, and future and progress. Participating teams must come up with innovative solutions to help governments better serve their citizens.

At each stop of the event, a winner for each category is announced and receives a $10,000 cash prize and a qualifying spot for the final, which is being hosted at WGS this year.

The winning teams from each leg of the competition then convene at WGS, where their winning innovations will be incubated at Dubai's Area 2071. A grand winner will be announced at the event and receive a $100,000 prize.

The unique international competition covers Washington DC, Berlin, London, Santiago, New Delhi, with the aim being that the innovation produced in each city should be implementable within the host city.

With the aim of identifying the most impactful technological solutions developed by top-tier local technology startups that can help governments better serve their citizens as they prepare for the future, the GovHack Series brings together technology pioneers and government officials to promote creative collaboration, dynamic thinking, and technological advancement.

The hackathon attracts some of the best talent in the world – including established programmers, software developers, tech entrepreneurs, and university students – to solve the most critical problems of today. It puts top tech thinkers at the center of the push for future-ready ideas that generate shared public value.

Bin Taliah added: The practical, real-world, solution-oriented character of each category of the GovTech Prize makes the award stand out for its timely contribution to resolving some of the most pervasive challenges facing humanity. As the pace of globalization and technological progress accelerates, the need to find smart solutions to our shared problems has never been greater. While smart technology is becoming increasingly integrated in the everyday lives of global citizens through mobiles, tablets, laptops, watches, and other gadgets, people in impoverished communities still struggle to satisfy their basic needs and human rights.”

The GovTech Prize seeks to bridge the gap between government decision makers and technology pioneers to encourage critical capability development and leverage new technologies to strengthen our communities. Core to its mission, the Prize rewards collaboration and creative ideas to ensure opportunities for innovation are identified and technology is utilized for the greatest social impact.

The World Government Summit 2019 is set to convene more than 4,000 participants from 140 countries, including heads of state and governments, as well as top-tier representatives of 30 international organizations. – TradeArabia News Service

The advisor to the Prime Minister of Pakistan on Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, Zulfi Bukhari, negotiated the launch of rent-free workspaces with Star Business Centre for new Pakistani entrepreneurs and business persons in Dubai.

This is in line with the UAE and Pakistan's economic reforms to support entrepreneurs in starting their businesses.

""We appreciate the spirit of Samana Group of Companies who have become the first Pakistani business group in Dubai offering rent-free workspaces for three months to new Pakistani entrepreneurs, business persons in Dubai,"" according to Bukhari.

This gesture is in line with the vision of Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan, helping Pakistan become a debt-free and economically independent country.

The recent spate of business-friendly reforms by the UAE government, including 10-year visas for investors and professionals as well as a move to allow 100 per cent foreign business ownership, along with some economic stimulus packages unveiled by Dubai and Abu Dhabi separately, have increased investor confidence of Pakistanis in the UAE.

The Star Business Centre offers workspaces in Dubai's sought-after business districts, Business Bay and Jumeirah Lake Towers.

The centre frees-up investors of the hassles that come with leasing conventional office spaces or building their own offices; a cost-effective, one-stop-shop for new businesses, multinationals, SMEs and the companies who are planning on re-structuring.

Entrepreneurs,Dubai,"Dubai: In a further boost to entrepreneur-backed businesses, Area 2071 has commenced the second class of Techstars’ start-up accelerators programme in Dubai. Area 2071 is a project from Dubai Future Foundation to connect start-ups with the government, and designed with UAE’s Centennial 2071 objectives.

“We think Area 2071 represents the vision of Dubai, and an ability to invent and move rapidly is one reason that is compatible to our core values,” said Vijay Tirathrai, managing director of Techstars Dubai. “This is not a physical space as compared to other hubs around the world. We have access to wider sectors that are supported by the leadership and Dubai Future Foundation.”

Techstars is an American seed accelerator with a worldwide network for entrepreneurs. Of the 1,000 start-up applications received globally, Tirathrai said Techstars, in partnership with Ginco Investments, select 10 entrepreneurs into the programme with a seed funding of $120,000 each and with an equity stake of 6 per cent.

Techstars runs 15 accelerators programmes globally, including the one in Dubai, and has 65 corporate partners.

“Our aim is to disrupt 12 industries — government, energy, transportation and logistics, retail, society development, construction, FMCG, pharma, finance and banking, education, media and communication, food and aviation,” said Maha Khamis Al Mezaina, director of Area 2071. “We value the technology these start-ups bring in and disrupt the industry.”

When asked about the difficulty in getting sizeable funding here, Tirathrai said Silicon Valley is the destination for tech start-ups to raise capital, especially from venture capital (VC) providers.

“However, when you see start-ups as an asset class looking for seed funding, the majority of investors are not VCs,” said Tirathrai. “They are angel investors and they are available everywhere. It is a question of how you engage them. With the programme that we have, we offer investors something they may not be able to do on their own.”

Entrepreneurs,Dubai,"Online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Booking.com and Expedia are taking advantage of hotels, according to the co-founder of direct hotel bookings platform BookedHappy.

Speaking to Arabian Business ahead of the platform’s launch, Charlotte Gossage said agencies’ powerful marketing tools have intimidated” hotels and prevented them from lowering rates on their own websites.

The platform, which is set to launch next week, aims to bring business back to hotels through direct bookings. It will include hotel deals on the platform, but refer customers to hotel websites to enable direct bookings.

Some hotels are slowly realising that even in an OTA contract, a hotel brand can give a lower rate. I think OTAs are taking advantage of their powerful position and intimidating hotels by preventing them from giving lower rates than them, when in fact, hotels can give lower rates through direct bookings,” Gossage said.

OTAs have so much marketing power behind them that hotels also show guests that they rely on OTAs. So we all feel comfortable going through the agencies,” she said.

The founder said OTAs have largely affected hotel bottom lines due to high commission charges.

OTAs told hotels, ‘Oh, we’ll help you to get your rooms filled,’ and then they took control. So hotels got a bit complacent, but room rates were at a four year low last year and hotels’ bottom line is really being affected,” she added.

Gossage claimed hotels give OTAs up to half a million US dollars in commission every year.

I wouldn’t be surprised if some hotels were giving half a million dollars to Booking.com a year. But if you look at Booking.com and see how many bookings have been made, keeping in mind that the average room rate is around [$100], even 15 percent commission is a lot of money,” Gossage said.

The founder also said hotels should work harder to get guests to book directly through their websites by improving them and offering extra perks.

The problem is that all hotel websites are cookie cutters and don’t stand out. Hotels can stand out more and that’s what we’re trying to do,” she said.

If customers book directly through hotel websites, they’re most likely to get extra perks such as a room upgrade. According to case studies we’ve conducted, families with kids are more likely to get a nicer room if they book directly with a hotel as opposed to through OTAs,” she added.

In September last year, a Netherlands-based start up told Arabian Business it is also aiming to ""give business back to hotels"" through a 0 percent commission model that takes on online travel agencies such as Booking.com and Expedia.

Bidroom boasts a 0 percent commission model and relies on annual subscriptions and memberships for profit.

Co-founder and CEO Michael Ros said the concept offers both hotels and guests more value for money by eliminating agency charges.

The hotels are very happy with us, because they’re getting their control back. Other booking platforms charge such high commission. So we give them their business back, plus direct reservations, so all the hotels came on board with us,” he said.

Because we don’t take commission, we create a win-win situation for both guests and hotels. If we don’t charge commission, hotels save a lot. And if we give on behalf of that back to guest, the guest is happy to save 10%. Hotels earn much more on reservations, so they’re more willing to give better discounts on room rates. We’re also a closed platform, so prices are not public,” Ros added.

Entrepreneurs,Dubai,"Jan. 6 -- Smart Dubai is gearing up to launch the third round of the Global Blockchain Challenge, organised in partnership with successful local accelerator the Dubai Future Accelerators (DFA), an initiative of the Dubai Future Foundation (DFF).

The Challenge seeks to source innovative Blockchain start-ups from around the world and bring them to Dubai, which, in turn, further establishes the emirate as an international capital for Blockchain technology.

The competition will be held at the Future Blockchain Summit, taking place on April 2-3, 2019, at the Dubai World Trade Centre, where teams shortlisted in the preliminary stages will be invited to come to Dubai and begin training with DFA ahead of the final Blockchain Challenge Presentation and Awarding Ceremony. Earlier in May 2018, the Future Blockchain Summit attracted 8,143 attendees, 140+ speakers, and more than 130 start-ups and entrepreneurs from 130 countries.

The objective of the Challenge to identify innovative projects that can contribute to the implementation of the Dubai Blockchain Strategy 2020, which was announced by Smart Dubai and the Dubai Future Foundation to make Dubai the first Blockchain-powered city by 2020.

Her Excellency Dr Aisha Bint Butti Bin Bishr, Director General of Smart Dubai, said: ""Dubai has established itself, and in record time, as a global destination for innovators and entrepreneurs in the Blockchain industry. Guided by the vision of our leadership, the emirate has become synonymous with bravely embracing avant-garde technologies and utilising them to create an advanced, connected and seamless urban experience for its residents and visitors.""

""To build a truly smart city,"" H.E. continued, ""we must establish and empower a holistic Blockchain ecosystem. This includes building the advanced infrastructure for the technology to thrive, but also, and perhaps more importantly, to attract talented and ambitious individuals and start-ups and empower them to implement their innovations - and that is the essence of the Blockchain Challenge, which now holds its third instalment.""

H.E. Dr Aisha added: ""The competition allows us to source highly skilled individuals with innovative and ambitious ideas, and bring them to Dubai where they can pilot their projects to channel Blockchain technology towards addressing people's needs and improving their lives. Building this ecosystem is a catalyst for the Dubai Paperless Strategy and the transition to a paperless government by the year 2021, as well as a key requirement for successfully implementing the Dubai Blockchain Strategy, launched by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council, in October 2016.""

For his part, H.E. Wesam Lootah, CEO of the Smart Dubai Government Establishment (SDG), noted: ""Dubai's ambitious plans to create a local and thriving industry around Blockchain are progressing rapidly with the Blockchain Strategy well on its way to fully digitising government operations, creating thousands of new tech and business opportunities in the process. This became evident as Dubai continuously ranked high, and on an international scale, in terms of attracting foreign direct investment and other competitiveness criteria.""

""The Global Blockchain Challenge allows us to attract start-ups and companies from around the world to pilot and implement their ideas in Dubai, which, in turn, opens new prospects for Blockchain applications that improve people's lives,"" H.E. Lootah asserted.

H.E. Khalfan Belhoul, CEO Of Dubai Future Foundation, said: ""We, at the Dubai Future Accelerators, work on providing an ecosystem to support innovation, encourage entrepreneurs, and incubate start-ups who have a main purpose of using advanced and emerging technologies such as Blockchain to develop and enhance government services. Our efforts also focus on promoting Dubai as a test bed for new innovations and new emerging technologies, whereby products and services that are in the pre-legal and pre-market stage are vetted and tested ahead of entering the commercial production stage."" He added that the Global Blockchain Challenge is a global platform, and a perfect setup for start-ups from across the world to present their ideas and projects and work in collaboration to pilot and test their technologies.

Finalists in the Global Blockchain Challenge will travel to Dubai to participate in a five-day programme, which will include an introduction to the UAE culture and processes of conducting business in the country, pitch presentation training, and finally a pitch competition that will be held as part of the Future Blockchain Summit, to an audience of investors, experts, private and public institutions. Three winners will be chosen among the finalists to receive first, second, and third place prize money of $20,000, $15,000 and $10,000, respectively, and the opportunity to implement their product or service in Dubai.

Last year, a prize pool of $45,000 went to three winners, who were selected from among 17 finalists from 14 countries - in turn shortlisted from 200 applicants. The winning start-ups were Ireland's AID Tech in first place, with the UAE's Smart Crowd and the USA's Codex rounding up the top three.

The Dubai Blockchain Strategy revolves around three main pillars: First, increasing government efficiency by transferring all applicable government transactions to the Blockchain network; second, creating a blockchain industry and ecosystem; and finally, leading the thinking and advancement of Blockchain technology around the world. The Blockchain Challenge will contribute to the Strategy's industry creation pillar by identifying the most innovative Blockchain ideas from start-ups around the world and bringing them to Dubai.

Intellectual Property Rights,Abu Dhabi,"A meeting between Mr. Abdulla J. Nowais, the CEO of Al-Nowais Group and Mr. Roberto Hroval, the Chairman of PatentReal Corporation has resulted in the progressive Abu Dhabi making a move towards technology-powered waste management.

Abu Dhabi - Oct 31st, 2018 - Abdulla J. Al Nowais and his company Al-Nowais Group has given the Chairman of PatentReal Corporation, Roberto Hroval, the green light for preparing plans for implementing the innovative waste to energy system, Product Reincarnation Technology™. Mr. Roberto Hroval was received by the CEO himself at the company’s headquarters where the presentation of the latest waste to energy technology, called Product Reincarnation Technology™ (PRT) was done.

PRT is a path-breaking technology designed to transform worn out products into fuel or electricity, or into brand new original products. PRT is a completely green process because of the closed loop system. It ensures that there no emissions into the air or ground. It also ensures high quality output products and an energetic utilization rate of above 85% which is quite impressive.

Because of its unique features, PRT technology is able to address two huge problems that the waste management sector is facing globally. One, it allows for better management of an ever-increasing quantum of waste and two, it helps in the production of inexpensive energy, while preserving the vital resources of our Earth.

While sharing his views about the waste management industry, Mr. Roberto Hroval said, “Today, we are not talking about useless and unwanted garbage anymore, because we use it as highly valuated material for production. So we use a term worn out products instead. Due to very clean nature of our technology, worn out and discarded products don´t harm and burden the nature any more, but can be very efficiently ´reincarnated´ into new useful and sellable products.”

Al Nowais and Hroval discussed the long-term nature of the project and the possibilities of implementing the technology in Abu Dhabi. The CEO of Al-Nowais Group confirmed that the project sounds very promising and agreed to have a long term view of it.

Al Nowais was pleased to learn that Abu Dhabi will be the first country to implement the latest version of Product Reincarnation Technology™ which has three patents included. “We look forward to exploring the opportunities for this technology in Abu Dhabi,” he added. “Any process that takes a serious environmental problem and converts it into an economic benefit deserves our fullest attention”.

Intellectual Property Rights,Dubai,"Seeking to ease investor concerns, embattled drug major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries on Tuesday announced plans to unwind loans of Rs 2,238 crore given to a Dubai-based company, Atlas Global Trading FZC, and transfer the distribution of the domestic formulation business to a subsidiary from a separate entity.

Sun Pharma said the company's consolidated balance sheet had receivables of Rs 2,238 crore from a non-related party.

""This liability was in respect of Atlas assuming the damages on account of Protonix patent litigation settlement entered by Sun Pharma, which was disclosed in Sun Pharma's annual report for fiscal year 2014,"" it said in a statement.

Last month, when investors had asked Sun Pharma Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi about the loans in a conference call, he said the loan was given to a ""non-related"" party, but did not give details.

The Sun Pharma stock has lost about 30 per cent, or Rs 42,700 crore, of its value since September as investors are worried about the company's corporate governance standards. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has also received two whistle-blower letters in this regard. The company has denied any wrongdoing and written to Sebi to investigate the share fall in recent days. On Tuesday, the stock closed at Rs 418 a share, up 5 per cent.

In Tuesday's statement, the company gave further details about the Atlas transaction and said its Halol facility in Gujarat had been impacted by US FDA issues since September 2014, which were finally resolved in June 2018.

Due to supply constraints arising as a result, Sun Pharma was not able to adhere to the agreed supply schedule with Atlas Global. ""Sun Pharma, in FY18, funded Atlas towards non-fulfilment of its supply obligations till the time such obligations are fulfilled in accordance with the agreement. The said funding was included in the loans and advances schedule of Sun Pharma's FY18 consolidated balance sheet,"" the pharma major said.

The parties to the supply contract have now agreed, Sun Pharma said, that Atlas would assign its rights and obligations arising from this contract to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Pharma. This assignment will ensure that the loans and advances given to Atlas will, therefore, be settled. ""On conclusion of this transaction, in the consolidated balance sheet, this loan and the obligation will cease to exist as it gets squared up. This transaction is expected to be concluded in FY19,"" the statement said.

Interestingly, in a note to its clients in October 2014, Credit Suisse had said Sun Pharma signed a deal with a third party where Sun would get $400 million in consideration for agreeing to sell pharmaceutical products at a negotiated discounted price. It made a provision of $438.5 million towards estimated expected liability on account of such discount on future sales. Credit Suisse further said Atlas Global was a group company of SuGandh Group of Dubai. ""Another company from SuGandh Group, SuGandh Management Consultancy, was a related party of Sun (an enterprise under significant influence of key management personnel or their relatives) till 28 February 2013,"" Credit Suisse had said. On a four-year compounded annual growth rate basis, the $38.5 million cost of discount comes to 2.3 per cent. This is similar to the interest cost for Sun Pharma for a foreign loan, the global brokerage said.

""Atlas Global Trading FZC is one of the leading basmati rice processing and marketing companies. It is an integrated player, undertaking activities right from procuring paddy to drying, de-husking, milling and polishing, colour sorting, grading, inspection, packing, branding, distribution and retailing,"" Credit Suisse further described Atlas quoting SuGandh Group's website. An email sent to SuGandh on Tuesday did not elicit any response.

The Sun Pharma statement said its domestic formulations distribution would be now transferred from Aditya Medisales, the current distributor and a related party, to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Pharma by the first quarter of the next financial year.

Further, the statement said it had not given loans or guarantees to Suraksha Realty, a company owned by Sudhir Valia, brother-in-law of Shangvi, a Sun Pharma director and co-promoter.

Sun Pharma also announced that it would replace Valia & Timbadia with SRBC & Co LLP, an EY audit firm, as statutory auditors of the subsidiaries of Sun Pharma as investors had earlier raised some queries on the previous auditor.

Intellectual Property Rights,Dubai,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Nov. 26 -- Recipient of the prestigious 2016 Australian Good Design Award for ""Best in Category"", SpaceGrill - the world's first full-sized, three burner ""fold-down"" barbecue - is officially launching in Dubai and the wider Middle East region this month. The Space Grill team chose the Middle East, because it is a region famed for a strong appetite for barbecue and grilling, and a harsh weather climate where it isn't always possible to cook outside and whose inhabitants frequently have little or any outdoor space, due to widespread apartment living.

With many Dubai and GCC residents enjoying apartment living, the award-winning Space Grill is a new-to-the-region cooking solution for those who enjoy a little al-fresco balcony dining but don't have the space for a full-sized BBQ. Developed as the ultimate outdoor cooking solution, Space Grill is a fold-away BBQ for those with limited outdoor space. It is a full sized 640mm x 480mm gas barbecue - with three individual rotary ignition stainless steel burners - that can be mounted to a wall or other vertical load bearing structure. Whether individuals have a smaller garden, a compact terrace area or balcony, they can now enjoy the delightful aroma and overall enjoyment that a BBQ brings.

Space Grill is an indoor approved fold-away BBQ, with a patented design that allows it to quickly and easily pull down from its vertical storage position to a horizontal cooking one, allowing individuals to grill in just ten seconds. Completely space saving, Space Grill can be set up or packed away in seconds, maximising outdoor living space.

Space Grill is a very design led barbecue, both in terms of appearance and functionality, making a Dubai launch seem particularly relevant given the large number of ""space poor"" urban dwellers. Space Grill has proved to also have broader appeal, with those who deem regular barbecues either an ""eyesore"" or ""clutter"" drawn to the retractable convenience and discrete aesthetic offered by it.

Weighing 35kg, Space Grill only has a pivot weight of 15kg. With the aid of inbuilt handles on its sides, it moves between positions with little effort. When retracted back down, Space Grill occupies almost 70% less space, protruding a fraction over 20cm from where its bracket is affixed.

Offering complete gourmet cooking, Space Grill has three stainless steel burners and a surface area of 640mm x 480mm consisting of an anti-stick ceramic coated cast iron plate, both flat and ridged, as well as a chef grade stainless steel grill, ensuring plenty of space to cater for family and friends.

Space Grill is easy to keep clean and well maintained, with a notable feature being its internal drip system which ensures any excess fat is captured in a detachable and pivoting drip tray. The team wanted to ensure that cooking remained the focus, not cleaning. Because of this, Ryan recommends dropping the Space Grill into the storage position so all the run off collects very quickly in the drip tray, and then ""pop off"" the tray and take inside to clean. The unit's cavity is shallow and every corner and surface easily wiped clean.

While the main goal was to create a space efficient full-sized barbecue, every effort was made to ensure Space Grill incorporated stylish and discrete design, as well as a number of carefully considered features to make it incredibly simple to operate, clean and store.

SPACE GRILL FEATURES

* Space to grill in 10 seconds: Aided by inbuilt handles, the patented design allows quick and easy transfer from vertical storage to a horizontal cooking position - and then back again after

* Full sized: 640mm x 480mm cooking area consisting of a ceramic-coated reversible cast iron plate (flat and ridged) and chef grade stainless steel grill

* Space efficient: When retracted down, Space Grill occupies almost 70% less space, protruding a fraction over 20cm from its mounting bracket

* Easy to clean: The anti-stick ceramic nano coating is easily wiped clean, while Space Grill's patented internal drip system ensures all run off is captured in a detachable tray that is easily removed and cleaned

* Convertible splash back: What is a splash back in ""cooking mode"" converts to a lid cover that neatly encloses Space Grill when folded down (A water-resistant black Oxford cloth cover provides still further protection)

* Durable: Made from high-quality weather proof stainless steel that's easy to clean and is highly corrosive resistant to moisture and salt

* Easy to install: Comes completely assembled and is easy to install, only requiring a bracket to be screwed to a load bearing wall or structure (a stand with bracket being available for those without a suitable load bearing structure)

* Portability: The mechanism in the mounting bracket allows Space Grill to be easily detached and moved to another location - or inside for the winter months

* Power: The three individual rotary ignition stainless steel burners can operate off bottled or mains gas, with gas outlets on either side offering greater flexibility

The Space Grill will retail at the same price as in Australia of AED 3799 including VAT and will be available from October 2018 through select retail partners and online at http://www.ae.space-grill.com[http://www.ae.space-grill.com].

About Space Grill:

Space Grill is the award-winning world's first full size fold down BBQ. Developed as the ultimate outdoor cooking solution for those who want a full-sized BBQ, but have limited outdoor space, such as those living in apartments with balconies and terraces and those with small gardens. Founder and inventor of Space Grill, Ryan Martin, tried to find such a barbecue for his modest balcony in Australia. Failing to find anything suitable - and enjoying outdoor cooking, as well as being fairly handy - Ryan decided the best solution was to make his own. Having designed and made his very first barbecue, friends of his started saying they wanted one, and so Space Grill was born. Space Grill has gone on to win many awards and accolades and is now available across the globe including the Middle East region.

Intellectual Property Rights,Dubai,"* Free zones in Dubai are becoming an increasingly attractive investment opportunity for drug makers.

* The rising incidence of non-communicable diseases and a push for economic diversification will make the UAE a progressively more attractive market for drug manufacturers.

* The UAE's pharmaceutical market is forecast to grow from AED10.4bn (USD2.8bn) in 2017 to AED20.6bn (USD5.6bn) by 2027.

 Pharmaceutical Market Growth Highlights Drug Maker Opportunities
 Pharmaceutical Market Forecast






f = Fitch Solutions forecast. Source: United Nations Comtrade Database UNSD/DESA, local news sources, domestic companies, Fitch Solutions

Free zones in Dubai are paving the way to become pharmaceutical manufacturing hubs. On the 27th of October 2018, the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) and the CEO of the Logistics District at Dubai South, Mohsen Ahmad, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The MOU aims to introduce legislation to simplify the licensing and registering process of pharmaceutical and medical equipment manufactures in the Dubai South free zone. This signifies the determination of Dubai South and the Emirati government to attract more drug manufacturers to the free zone in order to develop the region's pharmaceutical sector. Following the signing of the MOU, Ahmad stated that 'The agreement is an important move towards strengthening the performance of the pharmaceutical sector'.

In January 2018, a similar memorandum was signed between the MOHAP and officials from the Jebel Ali free zone (JAFZA), another free-trade zone within the emirate. The agreement states that both JAFZA and the MOHAP will work together to remove any barriers that may hinder the development of the pharmaceutical industry in the free zone. JAFZA is currently the home to many multinational healthcare companies, including; Johnson & Johnson ( J&J), Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline. It is hoped that the actions implemented as a result of this memorandum will see a rise in the number of pharmaceutical manufacturers in JAFZA. The agreement between JAFZA and MOHAP states that:

* JAFZA will create a simple procedure for licensing and registering pharmaceutical manufacturers,

* JAFZA will promote the importance of public health,

* The MOHAP will approve licenses for existing factories based on the industrial license issued by JAFZA (regardless of the nationality of the owners),

* The MOHAP will review its process of obtaining pharmaceutical approvals and permits,

* Factories will need to register their products and declare if they're for export or distribution. If the products are for use in the UAE then companies will need to obtain a medical warehouse license

The actions outlined in the agreements will greatly simplify and accelerate the process of registering a pharmaceutical manufacturing company in the aforementioned free zones, and potentially increase the ease of registering pharmaceutical products with the MOHAP. These MOUs, in addition to the associated tax exemptions and good transport links, will see free zones such as JAFZA and Dubai South become attractive investment opportunities for pharmaceutical manufacturers. The MOHAP estimates that the number of international pharmaceutical companies in JAFZA is set to rise to 75 in 2021, up from 54 in 2018. They also forecast that the number of pharmaceutical manufacturers in the UAE will rise to 34 in 2021, up from 17 in 2018.

Economic diversification efforts will boost investment opportunities. Dubai's 2030 industrial strategy intends to transform the federation into an international hub for knowledge-based, innovative and sustainable industrial activities. The strategies central aim is to develop Dubai's economy away from one based solely on oil. The industrial strategy outlines growing and developing the pharmaceutical industry as a key focus. Dubai is striving to become a destination renowned for its high-quality medical care and hopes to become a leading destination for medical tourism.

Currently, the UAE imports the majority of its pharmaceutical products, and the industrial strategy places emphasis on increasing domestic drug and healthcare equipment manufacturing to reduce this import reliance. It is hoped that the recently signed MOUs between the free zones and the MOHAP will assistance the growth of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing, helping the UAE to meet its industrial goals and develop its economy.

Rising incidence of non-communicable disease will provide further opportunities. The Middle East is currently experiencing a considerable surge in the incidence of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and cancer. This rise is due to lifestyle changes and a growing and aging population. The World Health Organisation (WHO) predicts that by 2030 the Middle East will have the highest relative increase in the incidence of cancer over all other regions in the world. Moreover, the Global Cancer Observatory (GCO) forecasts that by 2040 the incidence of cancer will rise to 19,067 new cases per annum, up from 4,707 in 2018, with the biggest rise expected among the elderly (70+). As chronic diseases become more common in the region, the demand for pharmaceuticals will continue to grow. Thus, Dubai is an attractive investment opportunity for multinational pharmaceutical manufacturers as it provides them with access to the rapidly growing Middle Eastern market.

Generic medicine sector the growth opportunity. The prescription drug market holds a significant share of the UAE's pharmaceutical market expenditure. Accounting for 84.8% in 2017, this is set to rise to beyond 90% by 2027. We forecast that spending in the prescription drug market will increase from AED9.0bn (USD2.4bn) in 2017 to AED18.7bn (USD5.1bn) in 2027, driven by the rising demand for chronic disease medicines.

Intellectual Property Rights,Dubai,"Sept. 27 -- The UAE has been among the global leaders in the fight against counterfeit drugs and implements a regional drug alert system, in line with its membership with the World Health Organization (WHO) - Uppsala Monitoring Centre, and that the country relentlessly works to develop regulatory legislation in accordance with international best practices, said H.E. Dr. Amin Hussein Al Amiri, Assistant Undersecretary of Public Health Policy and Licensing Sector, Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP).

Dr. Al Amiri was speaking during a speech on the opening day of the 2018 International Law Enforcement Intellectual Property Crime Conference to Combat Intellectual Property Crimes in the presence of His Excellency Lieutenant General Dhahi Khalfan Tamim, Deputy Chief of Police and Public Security in Dubai.

MOHAP's strategy against drug fraud

Dr. Al-Amiri noted that the Ministry has developed a monitoring system for the pharmaceutical market in the UAE and is updated on international advisories, leading the consistent monitoring of drug safety through the Supreme Committee for Pharmacovigilance, with representatives from all local health bodies. MOHAP is directly linked to the Uppsala Monitoring Centre of the WHO.

He added that the UAE Government's strict regulations have succeeded in reducing the spread of counterfeit medicines within UAE, and the country remains firm in upholding its commitment by continuously improving its regulatory structure and coordinating with TRA to block sites that promote counterfeit medicines.

The Ministry follows a five-point strategy to combat Illicit drugs, first of which include communications, education and awareness, organizing of bi-annual conference on the fight against drug fraud in partnership with regional and international experts, as well as reaching out to the public through periodic media announcements to raise awareness on the risks of buying drugs online. The second strategy focuses on strengthening cooperation with concerned government and private organizations and involving them in various committees to help combat the proliferation of the counterfeit drugs. The third strategy points to raising quality control and efficiency standards by improving the capabilities of the Quality Control Laboratory at the Dubai Research and Biotechnology Park in Dubai. The fourth strategy concentrates on securing the supply chain, and the fifth focuses on reinforcing the monitoring system and increase efforts in ensuring the UAE drug market is free of counterfeit medicines.

When Medicines turns into a Disease

Dr. Al-Amiri noted that selling of fake drugs is part of an organized crime, according to the World Health Organization, as these medicines deliberately target patients especially those suffering from chronic diseases. It is the number one crime against patients all over the world.

Fraud drugs are more dangerous than some diseases

Dr. Al Amiri explained that counterfeit medicines are drugs that are manufactured outside the legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturing system for the purpose of deceiving users by copying the original medicines, and may contain effective substances less than or greater than the suggested therapeutic dose, or improper and ineffective ingredients such as starch, chalk, or even harmful and sometimes poisonous ingredients. These drugs are manufactured in unsanitary conditions, leading to contamination. Often, fake drugs are boxed in packaging like those of original medicines, thus making it a crime of fraud.

Al Amiri emphasized that counterfeit medicines range from useless to a high degree of risk and that the person who uses the counterfeit medication puts his health, even his life in danger. He explained in detail some facts about drug fraud based on global studies and research, showing that most counterfeit drugs have 32.1 per cent do not contain the active ingredients, 21.4 per cent have wrong ingredients, 20.2 per cent contain incorrect amounts of the active ingredient, and 15.6 per cent are in the counterfeit packaging. About 8.5 per cent of these products contain high levels of impurities, toxins, and pollutants and 1 per cent are merely empty packets.

Global facts on counterfeit drugs

A World Bank 2016 report showed that USD 85 billion in global trading value per year, with USD 1 trillion in annualized value, was lost from the global economy. A 122 per cent growth in counterfeit medicines during 2010-2015 was also noted. A report by the World Health Organization in 2017 revealed that 10 per cent of the total global drug trade was counterfeit medicines, while 53 per cent of fake drugs are medicines classified as life-saving.

Quality and safety of medicines in UAE

Dr. Al Amiri said that the Ministry monitors any violation of drug regulations and adherence to laws, including prescriptions of narcotic and psychotropic drugs, in the country. It also sets the standards and oversees the registration of medical products according to international best practices using the established systems, including the GS1 system. Ministry officials are tasked to control drug prices and set the profit margins for pharmacies and distributors as well. They analyze pharmaceutical products and medicines at the Ministry's laboratory as well as protect intellectual property rights for innovative medicines.

Anti-drug fraud strategy

The Ministry's anti-drug fraud strategy comprises five key elements. First is hosting public meetings and conferences to raise community awareness. Second is to issue public advisors to warn community members about the risk of buying medicines from dubious online websites. The third is to strengthen cooperation and participation with relevant stakeholders; enhance quality control and efficiency at the Ministry's Pharmaceutical Control Laboratory through the adoption of technology. Fourth is to securing the supply chain by rolling our various initiatives such as the first smart medicine box by global pharmaceutical company Sanofi. Fifth is to strengthen surveillance and monitoring systems to ensure all medicines in the UAE market are safe.

Detection of counterfeit medicines within seven seconds

The TruScan device) TruScan RM analyzer (, the world's most sophisticated device for detecting counterfeit medicines across the country's air, sea and land frontiers, is one of the most important means of combating counterfeit medicines. It can detect fake medicines in their various forms (tablets, capsules, liquids, powders) for a maximum of seven seconds. The Ministry has distributed seven devices to the country's vital points such as the Abu Dhabi Airport, Sharjah Airport, Jebel Ali Port, and the Postal port, in addition to the Ministry of Health and Prevention's Quality Laboratory.

IP policy in the medical field

The Ministry of Health and Prevention has developed a national policy on intellectual property as part of its Cabinet-approved strategic plan to modernize and develop health policies and legislation as well as promote public-private partnerships in the local medical field. The Ministry aims to promote the country's health, economic, scientific, and cultural development through the protection of intellectual property (IP) rights.

Intellectual Property Rights,Dubai,"The UAE Trademark Department has issued an administrative decision to restrict the amending of trademark applications at the prosecution stage. In addition, the Dubai Economic Development Department has released a seasonal report to demonstrate their proactive approach to online enforcement, the removal of violating social media accounts and the advanced protection of trademark rights.

Trademark Prosecution Procedure in the UAE

The UAE Trademark Office has issued Administrative Circular No. 2 for 2018 ""New Circular"". The decision notifies registered attorneys and agents that amendments to applications prior to examination are no longer permitted. Following the implementation of an online platform to submit trademark applications in the UAE, the trademark office is now moving towards becoming more structured in coping with examination work and the rejection of unjustified amendments on applications. This circular ensures practical enforcement of the ""First to File"" doctrine to determine the eligibility to register a trademark in the UAE by limiting the applicant's ability to change or amend its applied mark details, including the image, list of designated goods/service etc. Therefore, applicants should expect provisional refusal in cases where they have filed applications with incorrect or inaccurate specifications even if such errors are spotted before the examination is conducted.

Whilst the Trademark Office New Circular restricts amendments on filed applications, it does allow for applicants to make changes in representation and to transfer responsibilities. The applicants will remain eligible to select a different trademark attorney and file for amendment to change the agent at any stage during the examination.

Intellectual Property and Trademark Enforcement Online in Dubai

Following the introduction of an online IP portal to receive and process complaints promptly, the Intellectual Property Division at Dubai Economic Development Department ""DED"" announced their takedown of 5,000 social media accounts that operated with the intention to sell, offer or merchandize counterfeit and/or IP infringing products within the UAE during the first 6 months of 2018. DED has been very active in fighting counterfeit trade in the UAE and has worked extensively with brand owners over the last few years to wipe clean the local markets. In the last 24 months, DED has focused its efforts on eliminating counterfeit trade operating via online platforms, such online marketplaces, social media, emails and URLs.

Moving forward, training department officials, recruiting skilled employees and adopting advanced technology is being considered and implemented by the IP division at DED. We can expect further efforts, partnerships and dialogue to be created with IP stakeholders and international organizations, such as INTA, IACC and the INTERPOL for the sake of anti-counterfeiting within the Emirate.

Intellectual Property Rights,Dubai,"Dubai, Oct 17 (IANS) Communications solution provider Avaya Holdings Corp is planning to roll out a social networking platform for chatbots next year which will enable bots to engage with each other and find answers to customers' questions that they have not been trained to answer.

The company has already applied for the technology patent and is expecting to release it for commercial use by the first quarter of the next year, Ahmed Helmy, Avaya's Solutions Architects Director for the Asia-Pacific (APAC) and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions, told IANS.

The US-based business communications leader showcased the platform at the Gitex Technology Week being held here in Dubai from October 14 to 18.

Drawing parallels from traditional social media, the technology provides a structured platform for bots to engage each other in a secure and controlled manner with the intent of extending the expertise and effectiveness of each individual chatbot.

Helmy said the biggest challenge for chatbots to service customer needs was to answer questions that don't fall entirely in their domain.

While acknowledging the growing customer acceptance, a key shortcoming of enterprise chatbots is that they are domain-specific and can respond only to a relatively narrow set of dialogues.

This has limited their ability to fully and efficiently service customers' requests when they face questions they haven't been trained to answer.

""But what if we could enable chatbots from different domains and industries to collaborate and exchange information via a highly regulated platform, and find answers from other chatbots, not just humans?

""We could, in effect, securely link enterprises, significantly expanding the efficacy and expertise of any single bot, thereby enabling organisations to deliver an exceptional level of customer service, reducing the need for human intervention and enabling deeper self-service, as well as reducing the need for supervised learning,"" Helmy said.

Giving an example, he elaborated: ""Like a chatbot for a restaurant aggregator may be able to recommend restaurants based on the customer's preferences. But if the customer wants to know if there is any special offer in a particular restaurant on his credit card, the chatbot may not be able to answer.

""However, if the same bot can refer this question to the said bank's chatbot, then it may be able to service the customer's need even though it wasn't trained to do so. This is the idea behind this social network for chatbots,"" Helmy explained.

A 2018 global Avaya survey of 8,000 consumers found that 80 per cent of people expect an immediate response from their banks, hospitals, hotels and even their governments, highlighting the need for efficient and 'always-on' customer service.

""With automation, organisations can overcome their human resource limitations and meet these customer expectations by delivering seamless, intuitive and intelligent experiences across all touch points. Bots are rapidly becoming one of the most powerful means to positively impact customer service, second only to face-to-face interaction,"" said Laurent Philonenko, Senior Vice President (Innovation) at Avaya.

Once deployed, Avaya's platform would allow any enterprise to register its chatbot with a unique social profile and 'friend' other member bots from different domains and industries.

It will also allow chatbots to rate each other, and store confidence metrics based on the quality of information received, and feedback from end customers, leading to constant improvements in each bot's quality and speed of customer service, a company spokesperson said.

""This is a huge step forward in addressing the information and service bottlenecks of chatbot systems,"" said Helmy. ""The social platform model also means that Avaya's customers can increase the value of their chatbot solutions without having to engage in lengthy and costly data curation or warehousing projects.""

NMDC will also work with international partners to deliver the project.

We are proud of our partnership with ADNOC and to be awarded this exciting new mega-project,"" H.E. Mohammed Al Rumaithi. ""We are also very pleased at the contribution this project will make to the local UAE economy, to supporting ADNOCs gas developments, and to progressing the UAE`s strategy to develop the maritime sector, in order to compete globally.

Enhancing In-Country Value is an important part of our work plan in the National Marine Dredging Company, as it is for ADNOC. We will achieve this by spending almost one billion dollars of the contract award in the UAE and creating additional employment opportunities for citizens in the maritime sector. We aim to increase the use of local resources, such as products, facilities and infrastructure in this sector of dredging equipment and services. NDMC will contribute to supporting the development and prosperity of the UAE.

Artificial islands provide significant cost and environmental benefits, particularly in shallow water, by enabling the use of lower-cost land-drilling rigs instead of high-cost offshore jack-up drilling rigs. They also provide greater flexibility for extended reach drilling when compared to offshore rigs. The use of artificial islands will eliminate the need to dredge over 100 locations for wells and provide additional habitats for marine life. ADNOC has a proven record of developing artificial islands, including the construction of four artificial islands for the Upper Zakum expansion project. ADNOCs Upper Zakum field is the second-largest offshore oil field and the fourth-largest oilfield in the world.

Her Excellency Dr. Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, Acting Secretary General of Environment Agency Abu Dhabi also attended the signing ceremony and commented: From the very early stages of exploration, ADNOC has worked in close partnership with the Environment Agency-Abu Dhabi (EAD) to ensure that this oil and gas development project, including artificial islands, is sustainable both for the environment and the people. This included conducting one of the largest marine environmental baseline surveys in the UAEs history in order to assess the marine life in the area, understand any potential impacts and ensure that the development and management plans protect the diverse marine ecosystems and mitigate any potential impact on the sensitive habitats and endangered species. We look forward to continuing this close collaboration with ADNOC and EAD as together we manage and develop Abu Dhabis natural resources sustainably and for the benefit of our nation.

The names of the new islands in the Ghasha Concession were drawn from pearl diving sites in the area and reflect the culture of the region. They are Ghanem, Sawalem, Chananiz, Mudaifena, Reeah, Seebeh, Seemeh, Shalhah, Jzool and Duroob. The pearl diving tradition is tightly woven into the UAE culture and dates back around 7,000 years ago, long before oil was discovered in the country.

ADNOC recently awarded stakes in the Ghasha Concession to Italys Eni (25%), Germanys Wintershall (10%) and Austrias OMV (5%). The mega-project is expected to produce over 1.5bn cubic feet of gas per day when it comes on stream around the middle of the next decade, enough to provide electricity to more than two million homes. In addition, more than 120,000 barrels per day of oil and high-value condensates are expected to be produced.

Saif Al Suwaidi, Undersecretary for Human Resources Affairs at MoHRE, highlighted that the Ministry is currently liaising with the concerned companies in regards to the next steps to hire the 123 candidates who had qualified to fill positions at the career fair, as well as the recruitment process for the Emiratis who received job offers during the event.

Recruitment,Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi: India has launched a crackdown on illegal agents who send women to work as housemaids by bypassing official channels meant to protect workers, officials said.

Police detained an agent in the Southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, who illegally sent a woman to the UAE to work as a housemaid, causing her many troubles, a top Indian diplomat told Gulf News.

“Based on the information gathered from the distressed female domestic workers who came to our embassy last week, we have conveyed the details of recruitment agents, who had duped them, to the relevant agencies in India. I am happy that police authorities in Andhra Pradesh have already initiated action against some of the offenders,” said Navdeep Singh Suri, the Indian Ambassador to the UAE.

“I hope this will send a suitable warning to others who are engaged in the abhorrent business of trafficking in human beings and exploitation of vulnerable women,” he said.

As Gulf News reported on December 12, four women who reached here on visit/tourist visa approached the embassy for help after going through disturbing experiences at the hands of unscrupulous recruitment agents and employers.

S.V, 44, from Andhra Pradesh said she landed at a UAE airport [which she cannot identify] on June 7 and three agents received her and kept her at their office for 10 days. She was sent to a house in Abu Dhabi where she worked for 17 to 18 hours a day.

As she received no salary, she went back to the agency who sent her to another Abu Dhabi house that paid her only Dh500 a month. She alleged physical abuse at employer’s home, ran away from there and took refuge at the embassy.

The agent in her hometown is being questioned by the police, Smita Pant, deputy head of the mission at the embassy told Gulf News on Thursday.

She said the embassy is following up the cases of three other women also with the Indian authorities.

The offenders will be booked for violating Indian emigration rules that have banned recruitment of housemaids under 30 [two women are under 30] and stipulated that eligible women should go abroad on an employment visa through eMigrate system that ensures their protection and welfare.

They will also be slapped with various provisions of criminal laws, the diplomat said.

She said India has ordered that recruitment of all female workers, including domestic helps, who hold ECR (Emigration Clearance Required) category passports, should be done by seven official agencies only.

India issues ECR category passports to those who have not passed Grade 10 and hence they need emigration clearance before going to work in 18 ECR countries that include the Gulf nations. This rule was made applicable to qualified Indian nurses also when India banned their recruitment by private agents for overseas jobs since April 30, 2015.

A Government of India order on August 2, 2016, has further extended this rule all female workers including domestic workers. The same seven official agencies are authorised for the recruitment of the nurses as well.

Mainly, companies depend on the seven authorised agents while individual employers in the UAE recruit maids through eMigrate system by registering themselves as a foreign employer. They have to make a refundable deposit of Dh9,200 at the Indian Embassy or Consulate, which will be refunded once the maid goes back without any complaints after the contractual term.

None of the 1,200 registered private recruitment agents in India are authorised to recruit nurses and female workers under ECR category.

Six of the seven official agencies are based in South India. Uttar Pradesh Financial Corporation (UPFC) under the Government of Uttar Pradesh is the only agent in North India, said the diplomat.

Recruitment,Abu Dhabi,"Alberta is seeking to hire a trade representative in the United Arab Emirates as Canada's energy-rich province looks to bolster its business in the Middle East.

The provincial government said Wednesday it will spend $600,000 on a three-year-contract to hire a trade specialist in the country, likely based out of Abu Dhabi or Dubai.

The move comes as Alberta strives to attract more investment from the UAE, as well as open new export markets for provincial companies.

""As a region, it acts as a hub in the Middle East and having a presence will help Alberta companies access the market,"" said Economic Development Minister Deron Bilous, while meeting in Calgary with UAE Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei.

""There are significant advantages with having someone in market, on the ground, to promote Alberta.""

Alberta already has 12 trade offices around the world - in countries such as China, India, Mexico, Japan and the United States - and is currently hiring a trade representative in San Francisco to attract business in Silicon Valley.

The new UAE trade specialist is expected to be in place by December, given the job of generating new investment leads and bolstering economic ties between Alberta and the Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

The UAE is a growing global financial centre, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries - Al Mazrouei is currently the group's president - and has the world's seventh-largest petroleum reserves, generating an estimated US$65 billion in hydrocarbon exports last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The bilateral trade between Alberta and the UAE has averaged $261 million over the past four years.

About half of the $30 billion the UAE has invested in Canada in the past decade flowed into Alberta, with Nova Chemicals owned by Mubadala Investment Co. of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.

Taqa North, the Abu Dhabi National Energy Co.'s North American subsidiary, is based in Calgary, and spent more than $7 billion on oilpatch acquisitions last decade.

Aside from petrochemicals, oil and natural gas, Al Mazrouei said the UAE is looking at potential investments and opportunities in Alberta renewable energy, food security, artificial intelligence, robotics and electrification.

""There are lots of exciting technologies, businesses, that Alberta has. The promotion of those cannot be done from remote distances, considering how far (apart) the two countries are,"" he said.

""Having someone there to link the companies here with their counterparts in the Emirates is a good step forward in promoting the businesses... but, at the same time, (it) helps us as well as investors to evaluate"" opportunities in Alberta, he added.

Recruitment,Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, 29th April, 2018 (WAM) -- Nasser bin Thani Al Hamli, Minister of Human Resources and Emiratisation, presented, with representatives of the telecommunications and technology sector during two recent meetings, the latest updates on the recruitment of Emirati citizens by the sector’s institutions and companies as part of their partnership to meet the sector’s Emiratisation targets, under the framework of the 3rd Government Accelerators.

The first meeting was held in Abu Dhabi, with the attendance of Saif Ahmed Al Suwaidi, Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation; Hamad Obaid Al Mansoori, Director-General of the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, TRA; Saeed Sultan Al Suwaidi, Deputy Director-General for Support Services at the TRA; Mohamed Al Hussaini, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company; and Saleh Al Abdooli, CEO of the Etisalat Group. The second meeting was held in Dubai, with the attendance of representatives of 20 companies in the telecommunications and technology sector.

Al Hamli said that the telecommunications and technology sector is a key economic sector that significantly contributes to the country’s GDP and is characterised by its rapid growth, making it capable of providing appropriate specialist jobs for Emirati nationals, which will enable them to participate in creating a competitive, knowledge-based economy.

He added that achieving the sector’s Emiratisation targets requires partnerships between all relevant institutions and a commitment to their responsibilities, to realise the desired outcomes of the Government Accelerators, promote future cooperation, achieve the directives of the wise leadership, and answer the aspirations of the country’s citizens.

He also highlighted the Ministry’s desire to complete its duties to meet the strategic plan of the Federal Government, most notably to achieve Emiratisation through initiatives and programmes that are planned to be launched by 2021 over three stages. The first stage involves promoting the direct hiring of citizens, while the second stage aims to empower them. The third stage seeks to raise their competitiveness in the job market.

Those attending both meetings discussed the challenges facing the Emiratisation of the telecommunications and technology sector, as well as creating new jobs that will promote the participation of Emirati nationals in this strategic sector.

The ministry’s Emiratisation challenge involves three other economic sectors, which are aviation and transportation, real estate development and the services sector.

Recruitment,Dubai,"Emirates is trying to recruit new staff in a bid to keep pace with its expanding strategy.

Dubai – Mubasher: ?Dubai government-owned carrier Emirates is reportedly seeking to hire pilots from other airlines including Etihad Airways, Norwegian Air Shuttle, and Hong Kong Airlines.

Facing hiring challenge, Emirates, the world’s largest airline by international passengers, is trying to recruit new staff in a bid to keep pace with its expanding strategy.

The current situation with several airlines in financial difficulty globally leaves Emirates in a good position to be sourcing and selecting good-quality pilots,” Bloomberg News reported, citing an internal memo from Emirates.

Recruitment,Dubai,"Boeing Co. hired nearly 600 workers at its North Charleston campus last year to build more 787 Dreamliner jets, but reports show a couple of big orders helping to back the production increase might be in jeopardy.

Aviation reporter Jon Ostrower first reported last week cracks in a deal by Emirates Airline to buy 40 787-10s, which are built exclusively in North Charleston.

Scott Hamilton, editor of aviation-focused Leeham News and Analysys, on Monday wrote that Emirates wants to cancel its order because the wide-body plane's Rolls Royce engines ""are too small for the very hot environment centered in Dubai,"" the carrier's home base.

The Emirates order — valued at $15.1 billion at list prices — was announced in November 2017 but has never officially been posted on Boeing's website. Bloomberg News also reported that the Emirates order might be canceled, but it did not cite a reason.

The ""Dash 10"" is the largest member of the three-jet Dreamliner family.

Hamilton told The Post and Courier that another United Arab Emirates carrier — Etihad Airways — wants to cancel its order for 787-10s. The Abu Dhabi airline has ordered 30 of the planes and has already taken delivery of four, according to Boeing's website. Etihad's planes are powered by GE engines.

Boeing spokeswoman Libba Holland said the company did not have a comment on the reports.

The news comes as Boeing is getting ready to boost Dreamliner production to 14 a month, up from the current 12, split between assembly sites in North Charleston and Everett, Wash.

David Carbon, vice president of 787 operations in South Carolina, told diplomats touring the South Carolina site in October that the aerospace giant was recruiting workers for the rate increase. Annual employment totals released by Boeing show the plant's headcount increased by 592 in 2018, bringing total employment to 7,341 workers.

All told, Boeing added 8,905 workers to its global payroll in 2018 — about half of them for commercial airplanes. The rest is split between the company's other divisions.

Hamilton said he doubts cancellations by Emirates and Etihad would alter Boeing's plans to increase 787 production because the company ""wants the cash flow for shareholder buybacks (and) dividends.""

Uresh Sheth, who tracks Dreamliner production on his All Things 787 website, reports ""there is evidence that Boeing is already at 14 (per month) as Boeing began final assembly on 14 787s during January.""

The company will probably start delivering at the 14-per-month rate in March or April, Sheth said.

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told financial analysts last week that ""we have started transitioning to 14 per month in our factories and supply chain ... (and) we expect to complete the transition in the second quarter.""

Other reports indicate Boeing has shortened its North Charleston final assembly turnaround time to 14 days per plane — down from 15 — with a goal of getting to 12 days when the production ramp-up is complete.

Sheth said an Emirates cancellation ""would be a big blow to Boeing,"" which wants to place Dreamliners in the fleets of all three major Gulf carriers. That includes Qatar Airways, which flies 30 787-8s and has an unfilled order for 30 787-9s.

Ostrower noted on his website, The Air Current, that the Emirates and Etihad deals are in jeopardy as the airlines reassess their future growth strategies. He pointed to myriad factors

""Now, falling oil prices, congested airspace, limited space at Dubai International and the unfinished Dubai World Central (airport) have all weighed on Emirates' expansion plans,"" Ostrower wrote. ""And bad bets on equity partners in Italy, Germany and India have scuttled Etihad's grand plans, too.""

Ostrower said growth of Middle East airlines ""has been caught in the undertow,"" adding ""the other shoe is starting to drop.""

The 787-10 has 169 official orders, according to Boeing's website, and has been stuck at that figure for about two years.

The Dreamliner program has a backlog of 622 planes — a little less than four years at the 14-per-month rate. Sheth said if Boeing gets fewer than 144 new orders annually for the next two years the production rate will be cut back to 12 per month.

Recruitment,Dubai,"French national and former senior Disney executive, Nicolas Torloting, has joined Dubai-based distributor Front Row Filmed Entertainment as its chief operating officer.

Torloting will take over running all day-to-day operations at Front Row while president Hisham AlGhanim and CEO Gianluca Chakra will continue to oversee all local and international acquisitions.

Torloting served over 15 years at The Walt Disney Company occupying key roles in finance, business development and strategy before taking on the senior manager role for licensed territories where he oversaw Disney’s partners for the MENA region, Greece, Israel and Turkey.

He said his part of his focus for growth in the region will be in Saudi Arabia, which last year lifted a decades-old ban on cinemas.

In 2012, he moved to the Saudi entity Disney Jawa Enterprise, a joint venture between The Walt Disney Company and the Saudi Jawa family.

With the opening of the Saudi market into the theatrical world and the quick and continuous market shifts, I believe that the MENA theatrical, TV and VOD markets will expand strongly in the upcoming years. Front Row, with its innovative culture will play a key role in taking the lead in this evolution,” he said.

His appointment is the latest made by Front Row which has been going through a major recruitment drive including Micallar Walker-Smith and Eli Touma.

Torloting said: I’ve known Gianluca and Hisham for over 15 years and saw their growth throughout, building an impressive set up making Front Row the most innovative and successful film distribution company in the Middle East.

""They’ve pioneered the VOD phenomenon, the aggregation deals with Apple and Google and worldwide sales to global platforms of local language products.""

Chakra added: Nicolas’ experience and wealth of knowledge especially in markets like Saudi will be key in expanding into that territory. We have already started acquiring IPs for local remakes, be it for television or feature films.

""Three projects are currently in development stage including the Arabic language remake of the Italian smash hit Perfect Strangers as well as a high concept international feature film which will be announced later on this year.”

AlGhanim said: We’ve financed a slate of high profile local language titles most of which will be released theatrically throughout 2019. We’ll keep on fortifying our relationships with regional players.

""Our roadmap is clear, Nicolas will focus on enhancing Front Row’s organization in order to keep leading the market changes whilst Gianluca and myself will expand the local production projects and develop an ambitious acquisition plan of international and Arabic language content.”

Recruitment,Dubai,"Migrant workers continue adding to the labour force of oil-rich Gulf due to mega-construction projects, UN data shows.

Blue-collar migrant workers continue adding to the labour force of the oil-rich Gulf, skewing long-standing efforts by its leaders to increase the percentage of its own citizens in the workforce, data of the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO) shows. Figures released this month in a 78-page study, ILO Global Estimates on National Migrant Workers, showed that the proportion of migrants in the eastern Arab region's workforce ballooned by 5.2 percent from 2013 to 2017, mostly in the construction sector. Migrants now make up 40.8 percent of the workforce across a 12-nation region that includes the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) bloc of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman. This is a much higher proportion than other rich regions that attract some of the world's estimated 164 million migrant workers. In comparison, migrants make up only 20.6 percent of the labour force in North America, and 17.8 percent in Europe. 171108145003698 In Dubai, Doha and other Gulf boomtowns, foreigners make up as much as 90 percent of workers, according to older figures. The ILO did not have data on separate countries for this month's report; Ryszard Cholewinski, the ILO's Beirut-based expert on migrant workers, said that figures provided by Gulf governments are often incomplete.

Blue collar jobs

The increase in labour flows to Gulf states these past five years was driven mainly by mega-construction projects, including pavilions for Expo 2020 Dubai and the Fifa World Cup 2022 stadiums being built across Qatar, said Cholewinski. Demand has also grown for maids, gardeners, drivers and other domestic staff, he added. In particular, more foreign carers are being hired to look after a growing number of elderly folks in their homes, as the Gulf population ages. ""The demand for male workers in the Arab states explains the sharp increase in the share of migrant workers in this region. Many of these workers are manual labourers, located mostly in the construction sector,"" Natalia Popova, an ILO labour economist, told Al Jazeera. ""Possible other reasons for the increase in the high share of migrant workers may include the increasing demand for domestic workers, both male and female, as well as for migrant workers in the hospitality sector.""

Nationalisation efforts

While data on nationalisation efforts is skewed due to the sheer amount of blue-collar migrants, Gulf leaders have long sought to boost the numbers of their working citizens, mainly in the white-collar workforce. However, state-led hiring drives, with such names as Qatarisation, Emiratisation and Saudisation, have had only limited success, particularly in the private sector, according to the ILO. ""Many of these nationalisation policies are not really having any impact. It's one of the region's big challenges,"" Cholewinski told Al Jazeera. 170609141743286 ""There's a lot of rhetoric on nationalisation [in for example Saudi Arabia's] Vision 2030 agenda. But in practice, this is going extremely slowly."" Al Jazeera contacted the UN missions of all six Gulf states by email and telephone over the course of several days, but was not able to get a comment on this issue. While each Gulf nation faces different challenges when it comes to nationalisation, many Gulf citizens loathe taking jobs in private companies, which cannot compete with the pension plans, generous holidays and shorter working hours in the cushy jobs-for-life enjoyed by civil servants. This can lead to odd distortions. A visitor to Dubai, the UAE's tourism hub, can spend their whole week-long vacation being served by migrant workers in shops, taxis and eateries, and the only Emirati they meet is a passport-stamping immigration clerk at the airport. Last month, the UAE launched it's so-called Citizen Redistribution Policy to temporarily shift civil servants into private sector jobs. It also rolled out training schemes for Emiratis and online recruitment tools. In recent months, Riyadh has introduced rules requiring shops to have Saudis in at least 70 percent of sales jobs. Expat workers pay monthly fees for their spouses and children, employers pay similar penalties for foreign employees. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 's ambitious Vision 2030 agenda aims to overhaul the Saudi economy by massively expanding the healthcare, education, recreation and tourism sectors and slash the high unemployment rates for young Saudis. John Shenton, chairman of the Chartered Institute of Building's Novus initiative, which supports construction jobs in Dubai, told Al Jazeera that Gulf nationalisation schemes were bearing fruit. In some state-regulated sectors, such as banking, legal and financial services, the number of local staff has grown, Shenton said. ""If the goal is to get more Emiratis in the workforce then it's having some effect,"" said Shenton. ""However there are other factors that will mean that those efforts may not be reflected in the data."" These gains are dwarfed by the mass-recruitment of foreign construction workers to build the skyscrapers, malls and artificial islands for which the region is famous, he added. ""At a site level, the chaps in safety boots and hard hats will always be from the subcontinent or South Asia,"" Shenton said. ""At the engineering and supervisory level, the skill set required can't be satisfied by the number of local graduates. The volume of work being undertaken and the discreet programme dates associated with projects like Qatar 2022 necessitate our hosts resourcing from overseas."" Melissa Roza, a headhunter at a Dubai-based recruitment firm, said nationalisation schemes had made gains in some white-collar jobs, but that state-set hiring quotas and penalty fees were also hurting these sectors. Banks in the UAE often prefer to pay fines for hiring foreigners than to cover the recruitment costs involved in hiring an Emirati, training them up and meeting their high salary expectations, she said. Executives have also found workarounds by hiring migrants via outsourcing firms, which do not affect the quota count, added Roza, whose name was changed so she could talk frankly on a hot-button issue.

We are excited about implementing the next phase of our CSR programs and we have launched two new projects: Goals for Hope and the Coscuez Health Clinic.""""CSR remains a priority across the breadth of Fura's operations. We continue to promote a process whereby the Company and communities work together, learning from each other, and making a positive contribution in our area of influence.""Social characterisation and baseline studyThe Company's sustainability team has completed 2,460 surveys as the basis for a social characterization study that included San Pablo de Borbur municipality's 26 veredas. The study's main objectives consisted of generating a population baseline to understand local conditions, gaps in development, the mentality of the community towards mining and to identify opportunities for short, medium and long-term projects. This has been vital in the development of communications and engagement strategies and assessment of risks and impacts.During this process, the main grievances voiced by community members were the lack of: economic opportunities in the area, access to training, access to higher education, gaps in investment in health and youths, as well as the absence of a platform to participate in decision-making processes within the region. It is based on the study, as well as constant interaction and engagement, that the Company has developed its CSR intervention lines and activities. Our CSR activities will be monitored and adjusted as a result of regular feedback from communities, and our baseline study, which the Company plans to carry out annually, will be updated.CSR intervention linesOpportunities have been developed to generate income for community members through employment, procurement and economic alternative programs The Company launched the first transparent recruitment process in the area in January 2018 and the second at the end of April 2018. This included educating local candidates in employment legislation and standards. During both recruitment stages, the Company received more than 1,500 resumes from local and regional candidates.To date, the Company has employed 270 people, of which over 90% are from the region, working in operations, administration and general services (cooking and cleaning). They receive salaries, health coverage and benefits according to Colombian legislation and for some this is the first time in their careers. This is a milestone in the region, in terms of formalisation and professionalisation of traditional and empirical mining activity.Additionally, local procurement processes have been strengthened in order to minimise the community's dependence on mining and to promote different economic lines. To date, more than 70 local suppliers ranging from food, textiles and tool construction have been supported in formalisation through investment by the Company and the provision by the Company of advice on legislation, taxes and financial management.Seamstress WorkshopOn October 14, 2018, the Coscuez Seamstress Workshop project was inaugurated by Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Executive Director of Dubai Multi Commodity Centre (DMCC). The Company provides ongoing support to the project in terms of procurement and business advice. Women taking part in the project approached the Company during socialisation sessions and developed their proposals during daily interactions with the Company's CSR team. Through activities such as these, the Company supports programs that champion women, promote their independence and offer formal employment that contribute to the overall income of their families.Furthermore, Fura Gems is developing plans to promote traditional regional vocations, to strengthen the communities' sense of belonging and discover new opportunities for growth. Currently, long term agricultural, services, tourism, and other economic lines are being discussed with communities, authorities and international parties.Bakery TrainingThis month, along with national and local partners, the Company has initiated a bakery training course run by the state National Learning Service (SENA) whereby participants will gain a nationally recognised certificate on completion. The project is a collaboration between institutions, the community and Fura Gems. The community school provided access to a building which Fura Gems refurbished, providing the necessary equipment and suppliers. The plan is that when the bakery reaches the targets it sets itself, Fura Gems will officially transfer the ownership of the equipment to the project.The idea for the bakery was proposed by a group of women with no formal business training but a clear desire for a brighter future. This project will give them initial financial support, practical training and ongoing advice. The mine and the community of over 2,000 persons currently import baked goods from Chiquinquira, which is a 3 hour drive away, so the bakery project will offer a level of independence to the community and while the mine itself will initially offer a client base, the aim is for the bakery to be an independent enterprise. The project was inaugurated by Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Executive Director of Dubai Multi Commodity Centre (DMCC) on October 14, 2018.Community Development SupportThe Company is engaging authorities at regional and national levels in order to identify local needs and initiate development partnerships for projects and investment. It is focusing its efforts on educational programs to help promote empowerment and support communities in becoming active participants in their development.Since February of this year, the Company has supported more than 14 regional initiatives and events including Quinchas Alliance Forum, National Miners' Festival, Borbur's Children's Day, sports activities in various municipalities and the iconic Otanche Culture Festival.English LessonsThe Company has started giving English language courses to 150 community members of all ages. This program was developed in response to community proposals during the socialisation sessions and currently has a waiting list of 200 people, who are working towards nationally recognised certificates aligned with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. The classes, which focus on speaking, listening, reading and speaking skills, are free of charge.Coscuez Health ClinicPlans are underway for a Health Clinic at Coscuez, which could potentially benefit 3,000 community members and Company workers by providing basic healthcare, which would reduce the 40 minute drive to the closest healthcare facility, which is currently in San Pablo de Borbur.Value Based Football CentreA value-based soccer initiative Goals for Hope will provide training for 300 youths as part of a 26 week program which will be rolled out before the end of the year in the Company's area of interest. The goal is to cultivate family values, discipline and physical and mental health through sports training. Children will be spend their free time productively, while integrating themselves into the wider community. The sessions will take place during the weekends and in various communities, so as to promote integration among parents and positive relationships between communities.Environmental SquadsEnvironmental squads comprised of former barqeueros, who used to contribute to contamination of water sources, are now in training to preserve and protect the environment through various activities conducted within the Company's environmental management plan. Youth environmental groups are also developed to educate children and train them in various environmental preservation activities. A series of tree plantation sessions have already been carried out.Communications and Social ContingencyThe Company considers maintaining transparent and continuous communication and dialogue with its stakeholders a priority of its CSR vision.

The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation announced the nomination of 713 male and female citizens for appointment at 117 companies operating in the financial, banking, retail and tourism sectors, as well as 144 others signing job offers with the concerned companies. This took part during the four open recruitment days organized recently by the Ministry in Al Ain and Dubai in cooperation with its partners from the federal and local government agencies, which organize the work of these sectors within the framework of the second phase of the Qualitative Emiratisation Acceleration Initiative.

Saif Ahmed Al Suwaidi, Undersecretary for Human Resources Affairs, said that the ""operations room"", which was formed by the Ministry within the framework of the open recruitment days methodology, is currently coordinating with the concerned companies to determine the procedure to be used to differentiate between male and female citizens, who have been included in the list of candidates for appointment in line with the policies of the human resources departments of these companies, in addition to following up on the procedures for signing the male and female citizens contracts who have received job offers"". He praised the active participation of these companies and their response to the Qualitative Emiratisation Acceleration Initiative in the targeted economic sectors.

Al-Suwaidi pointed out that ""the four open recruitment days, one of which was organized in Al Ain and the other three in Dubai, witnessed a remarkable turnout from a big number of male and female citizens, which reached a total of one thousand and 587 job seekers, which confirms their serious quest for job opportunities"".

Al-Suwaidi explained that during the four open recruitment days, the companies offered 995 job opportunities in the financial, insurance, retail and tourism sectors. 3,720 job interviews were conducted with male and female citizens, most of whom were interviewed in order to enhance their career opportunities, by allowing them to learn about the nature of all these opportunities as well as allowing the participating companies to learn more about the capabilities of the participating job seekers"".

The Undersecretary for Human Resources at the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation, said that ""610 male and female citizens from the total attendees were unable to pass the job interviews that were conducted for them during the four open recruitment days. He stressed that the ""operations room"" is currently coordinating with the concerned companies to find out why they did not pass interviews. This is done in order to communicate with male and female citizens, mentioned earlier, and invite them to participate in the ""Tamkeen Program"", which aims to train and qualify Emirati citizens who have not been able to pass job interviews and work to enable them to pass such interviews in the future and thus enhance their chances of getting a job.

He further stressed ""The effectiveness and importance of the open days in enhancing employment opportunities for citizens and accelerating Emiratisation and direct employment, especially as the outputs of the four open recruitment days in Al Ain and Dubai indicate that about 59 percent of male and female citizens who were interviewed benefited from their participation, both in terms of receiving job offers or being candidates for appointment. While others who have not been able to pass these interviews have benefited from being acquainted with the available job opportunities and the requirements that will help them overcome subsequent job interviews, especially as they will be rehabilitated and trained through the ""Tamkeen Program"" referred to earlier"".

The Ministry is scheduled to organize with its partners on October 1 and 2, two open recruitment days in Umm Al Quwain as part of pursuing the Qualitative Emiratisation Initiative, which aims to provide 3500 job opportunities for Emirati male and female citizens with 1,000 jobs in the financial and banking sector and another 500 in the insurance sector, in addition to 2000 jobs in the retail and tourism sectors within 100 days.

Recruitment,Dubai,"The $1 billion Dubai-based firm Huda Beauty is looking to hire more talent as it eyes expansion across the US and Europe.

The brain child of prominent social media influencer Huda Kattan is a cosmetics firm boasting products ranging from skin foundations to false lashes and eyeshadow palettes. It recently hired a US and Europe president for its offices abroad, which also include one in the UK.

Speaking to Arabian Business, founder and chairwoman Kattan said the firm needs a bigger team to lessen the workload at its headquarters in Dubai.

We don’t have a lot of people on the team. It’s crazy how much the people here do. But we definitely need support. People would feel better and more relaxed,” she said, adding that finding talent is one of the company’s main challenges.

When we recently hired our European president, she came over and said, ‘I still don’t know how you guys are doing the numbers you’re doing with this few people.’ And I said, ‘Me neither.’ So I do feel that if we hired more brilliant people, we would be able to do much more. It’s hard hiring talent. We’re very particular with the people we hire. It’s part of the challenge,” she said.

The firm’s US office, which is currently being built, will mark its second headquarters, while the main office will remain in Dubai.

Huda Beauty co-founder and global president Mona Kattan said part of the reason behind the company’s success is its meticulous approach towards cost control since its inception.

We all wore a million hats. Normally, to have run an organisation the size of our business at the time, would probably have needed five times the people we had. But we didn’t go out and hire a bunch of people. Whatever needed to be done, we learned how to do ourselves or our team did,” she said.

Huda added that part of minimalising expenses was opting out of using agencies for public relations or marketing purposes.

We didn’t do agencies at all. We were always very diligent. We didn’t have a lot of expenses right in the beginning. A lot of team members said, ‘We want you to use an agency.’ And I said, ‘Why do you want to use an agency when you’re so brilliant?’ And it’s funny because we’ve pushed a lot of people and they really rose to the occasion,” she said.

Kattan, who has 27 million followers on Instagram and 2.4m on YouTube, initially gained fame on YouTube in 2010 after sharing free make up tips and tricks. She swiftly garnered millions of followers due to her credibility and limited sponsorships and ads.

Recruitment,Dubai,"French national and former senior Disney executive, Nicolas Torloting, has joined Dubai-based distributor Front Row Filmed Entertainment as its chief operating officer.

Torloting will take over running all day-to-day operations at Front Row while president Hisham AlGhanim and CEO Gianluca Chakra will continue to oversee all local and international acquisitions.

Torloting served over 15 years at The Walt Disney Company occupying key roles in finance, business development and strategy before taking on the senior manager role for licensed territories where he oversaw Disney’s partners for the MENA region, Greece, Israel and Turkey.

He said his part of his focus for growth in the region will be in Saudi Arabia, which last year lifted a decades-old ban on cinemas.

In 2012, he moved to the Saudi entity Disney Jawa Enterprise, a joint venture between The Walt Disney Company and the Saudi Jawa family.

With the opening of the Saudi market into the theatrical world and the quick and continuous market shifts, I believe that the MENA theatrical, TV and VOD markets will expand strongly in the upcoming years. Front Row, with its innovative culture will play a key role in taking the lead in this evolution,” he said.

His appointment is the latest made by Front Row which has been going through a major recruitment drive including Micallar Walker-Smith and Eli Touma.

Torloting said: I’ve known Gianluca and Hisham for over 15 years and saw their growth throughout, building an impressive set up making Front Row the most innovative and successful film distribution company in the Middle East.

""They’ve pioneered the VOD phenomenon, the aggregation deals with Apple and Google and worldwide sales to global platforms of local language products.""

Chakra added: Nicolas’ experience and wealth of knowledge especially in markets like Saudi will be key in expanding into that territory. We have already started acquiring IPs for local remakes, be it for television or feature films.

""Three projects are currently in development stage including the Arabic language remake of the Italian smash hit Perfect Strangers as well as a high concept international feature film which will be announced later on this year.”

AlGhanim said: We’ve financed a slate of high profile local language titles most of which will be released theatrically throughout 2019. We’ll keep on fortifying our relationships with regional players.

""Our roadmap is clear, Nicolas will focus on enhancing Front Row’s organization in order to keep leading the market changes whilst Gianluca and myself will expand the local production projects and develop an ambitious acquisition plan of international and Arabic language content.”

Recruitment,Dubai,"Dubai, July 31 -- Emirates NBD, one of the leading banking groups in the region, convened a panel discussion to debunk myths among UAE companies on employing people of determination (people with disabilities).

Held under the bank's #TogetherLimitless advocacy platform for persons of determination, the event discussed key findings of research commissioned by the bank to better understand UAE employers' perceptions on hiring people of determination. The Ipsos-led research interviewed 70 C-level executives and HR managers from companies with 75 plus employees across Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah through face-to-face meetings, online questionnaires and included seven in-depth face-to-face interviews.

In conjunction with the research, Emirates NBD has also published a whitepaper (www.emiratesnbd.com/pwdwhitepaper[http://www.emiratesnbd.com/pwdwhitepaper]) based on qualitative interviews with 15 persons from UAE-based private sector companies affiliated to Careers Network, and organisations like Manzil and Community Development Authority, Dubai.

At the panel discussion, speakers comprising private sector employers and government policy makers debunked myths around employing people of determination by sharing first-hand experiences and successful strategies.

Panelists also highlighted the support provided by Emirates NBD's The Careers Network, a workplace inclusion initiative under #TogetherLimitless that connects work-ready candidates to employers interested in bringing diversity into their workforces. Quarterly recruitment 'Meet Ups' as well as workplace inclusion workshops, candidate assessments, selection and job coaching are offered free of cost to UAE companies by The Careers Network.

Panelists included: Deepak Malathi, Head of HR - Fashion Division, Splash (part of Landmark Group); Fatima Abdulrahman, Chief Human Resources Officer, Tanfeeth (part of Emirates NBD group); Dr. Hussain Al Maseeh - Expert - Social Development and Care Sector- Community Development Authority; and Yassine Bakkari, Operations Director and Diversity Champion, L'Oreal Middle East.

During the discussion, Fatima Abdulrahman, Chief Human Resources Officer, Tanfeeth stated, ""Hiring people of determination needs several prerequisites in place to ensure that the experience is mutually beneficial and fulfilling for both the employee and employer. As an employer, creating an inclusive corporate culture that accepts people from all walks of life is priority. This attitude can be achieved by including informal discussions, educational internal communications and employee volunteering opportunities. It is also very important that the job description is customized to the employees needs and capabilities to ultimately provide a sense of fulfilment to the

employee. Research shows that hiring people with disabilities also translates into increased employee engagement, which in turn drives profitability.""

Dr. Hussain Maseeh - Expert - Social Development and Care Sector- Community Development Authority added: ""There is a definite increase in awareness and willingness from the public and private sectors to support people of determination. However, more dedication is required from the private sector to support Emiratis and non-Emiratis with disabilities. Initiatives such as today's discussion underline the importance of an inclusive environment at workplaces across the country and I am confident that our efforts will contribute to the vision of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council to make Dubai a disability-friendly city by 2020.""

""Our mission at L'Oreal is to bring ""Beauty for all"", and at the heart of this mission is our diversity strategy, so we strive to provide an environment that is inclusive for all employees of different backgrounds and needs. Our journey to become one of the leaders in diversity and inclusion started ten years ago when we issued a global policy to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities. Today, the Group has employed over 1,200 people who are differently-abled in various functions and roles across the world. This has inspired us, at L'Oreal Middle East, to follow the same vision and aim by having 2% of our talent pool to be differently-abled by end of year,"" said Yassine Bakkari, Operations Director and Diversity Champion at L'Oreal Middle East. ""According to the 2016 Annual Report of Global Economics of Disability, 85% of disabilities are acquired during life, hence we will continue to intensify our efforts to attract more and more differently-abled people by offering them a work environment and careers that are adapted to their specific needs.""

Today's panel discussion was part of #TogetherLimitless' series of quarterly town-hall sessions to build community awareness toward disability mainstreaming. In the 18 months since its launch, the bank's Careers Network has helped over 50 candidates gain employment among 19 companies.

Recruitment,Dubai,"The human factor” that is key to healthy life and success in work is at the heart of a new psychology course at a UAE university.

Canadian University Dubai, where the head of the course said the UAE is an exciting backdrop” for study, has introduced a bachelor’s degree in psychology.

Dr Stefane Mostefa Kabene said psychologists will play an important role in helping businesses to evaluate the leadership skills of employees and help with recruitment to ensure employers hire the people with the skills for the job.

Psychology is also vital to the Government’s vision of a population that is healthy in mind as well as body, he said.

As a young society with a high expat population and so many different cultural dimensions, the UAE presents an exciting backdrop for the study and practice of psychology,” said Dr Kabene, the programme leader.

It is also a profession where women are very well represented and so holds great potential to strengthen the female workforce.”

He said the Canadian University Dubai curriculum prepares students for becoming clinical psychologists, but also prepares them in everything from cultural or sports psychology to educational or industrial psychology”.

Clinical and child psychology are popular all around the world, but especially in the UAE,” said Dr Kabene.

Forensic psychology is also in high demand, while industrial, organisational and business psychology are needed by businesses and other organisations to assess the human factors at work in leadership, management, recruitment, and performance assessment roles.

Psychology is one of the popular specialisations that attracts students who plan to have a career in which understanding the behaviour of humans is a key element,” said Dr Kabene. Holders of a bachelor’s degree in psychology can pursue their studies to become a social worker, teacher, or a certified psychologist.

Dr Kabene, who has work in psychology and focused on leadership and management for a quarter of a century, said the UAE is one of the world’s fastest changing societies. As such, the need for psychologists to help in the transitions and change accepting is important.”

The demand for psychology courses follows trend where students are leaving traditional subjects such as engineering and computer sciences behind.

With the rise of artificial intelligence, computer science presents many opportunties for students.

QS World University Ranking, an independent body which evaluates global university performance, found that engineering was the most popular subject among their readers globally last year with computer science and information systems coming in second.

Shyamala Elango, director of education consultancy, Inner Universe, said that many students are also opting for computer science and related fields.

Computer science is the biggest option. We find our biggest student numbers there. Accounting and finance is the second biggest area. Engineering is still popular and medicine and law come after that,” said Ms Elango.

Economics has picked up substantially and this is because people are able to relate the principles of economics with what is happening in the world.”

She said the popularity of economics is connected deeply with the political and economic shifts the world is witnessing. _________

Ameerah Parvez, a student at Gems Wellington Academy Silicon Oasis said that of her peers, business, engineering, and science and maths subjects are still popular.

This is being encouraged by the emphasis our learning placed on the rise of technology, and how this may influence one’s career in an ever-changing future,” said Ms Parvez.

Stuart Walker, head of Gems World Academy Dubai said that cultural issues play a role in determining the subjects children study.

Asian parents still want their children to do medicine, law and accounting. We work to ensure that the child goes to the right course for them and understand what they’re passionate about.

You get a lot of parents who just want to ensure their child to go to Harvard or Oxford. Ivy league is all that they are interested in. In some cases, those universities are not the best fit for those students. We try to make sure they get to their best choice university,” said Mr Walker.

Computer science, global politics and psychology are attracting many students at the school.

In 2017, Times Higher Education found that in UK, the most popular courses for female undergraduate students were those related to medicine and the second most popular choice was business and administration subjects.

The most popular course chosen by male first-year undergraduates were business related subjects and the second most popular course was engineering.

Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Department of Chemical Engineering, ""Herein, we used bimetallic silver (Ag) - copper (Cu) decorated graphene (ACG) nanocomposite as the anode electrode material for the HCDI application and studied its deionization performance. Also, the HCDI performance of the ACG has been compared with monometallic Cu-doped graphene (CG) and Ag-doped graphene (AG) nanocomposites. Both the bimetallic and monometallic nanocomposites have been generated by a facile thermal treatment method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the existence of Cu and Ag nanoparticle in the graphene nanostructure with the +2 and 0 oxidation states respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis displays the uniform distribution of nanoparticles with both phases of Cu and Ag on the graphene sheets and the size of around 20-60 nm. Electrochemical measurements showed that the ACG exhibits the good specific capacitance of 128 Fg(-1) as compared to monometallic AG and CG composites of 118 Fg(-1) and 101 Fg(-1) respectively. Furthermore, the HCDI measurements reveal that the ACG nanocomposite electrode showed the salt adsorption capacity (SAC) of 16.81 mg g(-1) with initial salt concentration of 600 ppm, and the applied voltage of 1.2 V. Besides, the ACG based HCDI cell possessed the charge efficiency of 90% and the energy consumption of 88 kJ mol(-1) at 1.2 V. Also, the ACG nanocomposite electrode showed good stability regeneration ability over 10 charge - discharge cycles.""

Research and development,Abu Dhabi,"2019 FEB 8 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Economics Week -- Research findings on Sustainability Research - Sustainable Energy are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting originating in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, ""Fly ash was converted to a Cancrinite-type zeolite and then functionalized with various amines to investigate its ability to adsorb CO2. Fly ash was first subjected to thermal-alkaline treatment followed by hydrothermal treatment to remove unburned carbon and transform it into a cancrinite-type zeolite before being functionalized with either 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), diethanolamine (DEA), or monoethanolamine (MEA).""

Funders for this research include Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, Engineering Solutions and Minerals, DMCC Dubai.

The news reporters obtained a quote from the research, ""The resulting Cancrinite and its functionalized products were characterized by various techniques to confirm the success of fly ash to Cancrinite transformation and functionalization method. Cancrinite has significant improvement in surface area (77.7 m(2) g(-1)) in comparison with original fly ash (11.2 m(2) g(-1)), but its CO2 adsorption is very poor, about 6.6 mg g(-1). Amine functionalization caused a reduction in the surface area and porosity of the fly ash Cancrinite, however, it enhanced the CO2 adsorption significantly. While the sorbents impregnated with DEA and MEA had higher CO2 adsorption capacities (49 and 84 mg CO2/g adsorbent respectively) than the sorbent grafted with APTES (24 mg CO2/g adsorbent), the grafted sorbent was more stable over multiple adsorption-desorption cycles.""

According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""This study demonstrated that fly ash-derived Cancrinite-type zeolite has low CO2 adsorption in spite of its high surface area, however, its CO2 adsorption can be improved by amine-functionalization.""

According to news reporting from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, ""This study focuses on students' interest in ecosystem services and sustainability to explain their awareness and optimism about the environmental issues of air pollution, water shortage and greenhouse gas emission in 50 countries around the world. We achieve this using the cross-sectional survey data of the 2015 OECD's Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), along with seemingly unrelated bi-variate weighted ordered probit modeling.""

The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the College of Business, ""We found that in addition to factors such as age, gender, immigration status, and economic, social and cultural status, interest in the biosphere is a significant determinant of students' environmental awareness and optimism. In fact, a level increase in students' interest in ecosystem services and sustainability is found to raise on average their awareness level by 15.3% for the issue of air pollution, 15.7% for the issue of water shortage, and 24.6% for the issue of greenhouse gas emission. Although students' interest in the biosphere seems to not have a significant effect on their expectations about the issue of greenhouse gas emission, it does however raise their level of optimism by 0.8% for the issue of air pollution, and 0.2% for the issue of water shortage. Furthermore, every level increase in students' environmental awareness is found to raise their optimism level by 17.3% for the issue of air pollution, 15.8% for the issue of water shortage, and 17.4% for the issue of greenhouse gas emission.""

According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Therefore, relying on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), our results suggest that governments and policy makers around the world could successfully leverage the biospheric interests of their youth populations to successfully achieve their 2030 goals for sustainability.""

Research and development,Abu Dhabi,"2018 DEC 12 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Computer Weekly News -- New research on Information Technology - Cloud Computing is the subject of a report. According to news reporting originating in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, ""The era of cloud computing allows the instant scale up of provided services into massive capacities without the need for investing in any new on-site infrastructure. Hence, the interest of these type of services has been increased.""

The news reporters obtained a quote from the research, ""In addition, large companies may wish to provide support for wide range of load capacities, including peak ones. This, however, will require higher costs in order to build larger data centers internally. Cloud services can provide infrastructure, platform or software as a service for institutions or individuals that are in need for variable computation resources. Therefore, resource sharing and provisioning is considered as one of the most challenging problems in cloud-based services, as they have become more numerous and dynamic. As a result, assigning tasks and service requests into available resources has become a persistent problem in cloud computing given the large number of variables, and the increasing types of services, demand, and requirements. Scheduling services using a limited number of resources is a problem that is known to be NP-complete. Hence, heuristic-based methods are usually used in order to provide better solutions. This work discusses the formalization of the problem of scheduling multiple tasks requested by multiple users and then proposes a genetic algorithmic-based solution to schedule tasks across limited resources. The algorithm is presented and evaluated for optimum schedule that allocates a number of subtasks on a given number of resources, and the algorithm is shown to be linear versus number of users and number of resources. On the other hand, the main limitation of the proposed algorithm is that it is only applicable to the scheduling problems of multiple tasks with one price vector and one execution time vector.""

According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""However, scheduling multiple users, each with subtasks that have their own price and execution time vector, is very complex problem and beyond the scope of this work, hence it will be addressed in future work.""

Research and development,Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) on Monday announced its collaboration with Al Hilal Bank and Jibrel Network to develop and test the next generation of shariah-complaint sukuk transactions.

The pilot scheme is based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) in the ADGM Regulatory Laboratory (RegLab), a statement said.

It added that UAE-based Al Hilal Bank has partnered with FinTech firm Jibrel Network to pilot the first Shariah-compliant purchase and settlement sukuk transaction using blockchain technology.

The partnership was made possible through the Plug and Play ADGM innovation platform, where financial institutions in the MENA region can accelerate their digital transformation agenda by connecting with FinTech startups locally and globally.

Jibrel Network will work with Al Hilal Bank to accelerate the adoption of DLT for the Islamic finance sector under the supervision of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the ADGM.

Alex Coelho, CEO of Al Hilal Bank, said: We are proud to be the first bank to launch a ‘smart blockchain Islamic sukuk; once again the bank has demonstrated that it has the capabilities of leading in the competitive market of Islamic banking.

""The partnership between Al Hilal and UAE incubated startup, Jibrel, highlights ADGM’s success in attracting, nurturing and fostering innovation.”

Research and development,Abu Dhabi,"2018 NOV 26 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Nanotechnology Weekly -- Research findings on Polyethylene Glycols are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, by VerticalNews journalists, research stated, ""Magnetic hydrogel composite beads were prepared by impregnating iron oxide nanoparticles (NP) into macroporous calcium alginate gel (Alg) and used as an adsorbent (Alg/iron oxide-NP) for the removal of sulfide from aqueous solutions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopic analyses were performed to characterize the iron oxide nanoparticles and the Alg/iron oxide-NP for exploring the mechanism involved in sulfide removal.""

The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the Department of Chemical Engineering, ""The experimental results showed that adsorption of sulfide on Alg/iron oxide-NP beads reached equilibrium within 3 h. At pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C, Alg/iron oxide-NP was capable of reducing sulfide concentration from 64.3 to 1.1 mg/L, thus achieving more than 98% removal. The removal of sulfide decreased with the increase in solution ionic strength. The equilibrium isotherm studies obeyed Langmuir model better than Freundlich model. The maximum uptake capacity was found to be 136.9 mg/g. Pseudo-second-order model described the kinetics of sulfide adsorption having rate constant 0.004 gmg(-1) min(-1). The proposed mechanism and the experimental data evidenced that chemical interaction was involved in adsorption wherein elemental sulfur and sulfates were produced as byproducts. The adsorbent was regenerated with calcium chloride solution. In five adsorption-desorption cycles, the adsorbent lost less than 5% of its removal efficiency. The magnetic property of the iron oxide nanoparticles enabled easy and rapid separation of the adsorbent from the solution via magnetic field.""

According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""The synthesized magnetic composite had comparable if not superior adsorption capacity in comparison with carbon-based adsorbents.""

Research and development,Dubai,"As per reports, Etisalat of UAE selects multiple companies to foster the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain-based projects and solutions under the Companys innovation program, Future Now. The Government is cementing its vision to have an ecosystem in UAE where the Government Blockchain-based and AI-based Business is around 50% by 2021.

UAE and Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology is gradually disrupting and has disrupted almost all the major world business sectors. This application has helped to elevate the level of efficiency and capacity which earlier existed in the same industry. The time factor and the amount of work done in the same period have hugely cut down. All the dominant countries in the World have already dealt into the application of the blockchain technology in their country. One such highly involved country/countries, in this case, is UAE (United Arab Emirates), the country which executed the worlds first blockchain-based Sukuk transaction.

With the launch of the Global Blockchain Council, Dubai already made an entry to this field in early 2016. Then later the same year, H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai Crown Prince and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Dubai Future Foundation announced Dubais Blockchain Strategy. This planning was also coined as Smart Dubai Vision 2021.

IBM is the key partner of UAE in the development of various emerging high-class blockchain projects. IBM has handled many complexities yet interesting use cases for the country. An example of same would be the Adoption of IBM blockchain by the Dept. of Economic Development (DED) to make issuance of business licenses, exchange of commerce information between government institutions, free zones and between private companies completely digitized. Dubai is the city of firsts and hence have also launched the first government-backed blockchain service in the UAE.

Etisalat Signed an Agreement With 4 Firms to Work on Blockchain and AI Solutions

Emirates Telecommunication Group Company PJSC which is being branded under Etisalat is a multinational Emirati based telecommunications services provider with presence in almost 15 countries. As of 2014, the Company was the 14th largest mobile network operator in the world.

The Companies selection was done with regard to the prior requirements and challenges. Companies were selected considering the prevailing challenges.

Companies selected for the AI solutions based project were Yitu Technology and Com IoT Technologies. The challenge here is to develop AI based platform for video surveillance systems and also solutions pertaining to the reduction of crime rates and road congestion. Solutions are expected to trigger behavior based and automated decisions will be executed safely.

The Next Challenge is related to the usage of blockchain technology to curb the transactional costs and complexity involved in business processes in banks, government agencies and private entities. The expected time to finish the project completely is 5 years with an aim of 40% reduction by that time. This challenge was assigned to 300cubits.

The second blockchain-based challenge was assigned to Tradefin to develop systems to enable proper currency exchanges. To be precise the interconversion between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. This would be helpful for the people to do an effortless online and physical transaction with any of the currencies available with them.

Research and development,Dubai,"2018 NOV 16 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Science Letter -- Research findings on Science are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, ""Data on the diversity and relative abundance of elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) in the Arabian Gulf have been limited to fishery-dependent monitoring of landing sites. Understanding the diversity and abundance of sharks and rays is, however, crucial to inform policy and management plans.""

The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research, ""Baited Remote Underwater Video Surveys (BRUVS) were conducted in 2015-2016 across the United Arab Emirates Arabian Gulf waters encompassing a range of depths and habitat types. Data from 278 BRUVS (757 hours soak time) were analysed to gather information on diversity, relative abundance, species distribution, and habitat associations. Surveys recorded 213 individuals from 20 species of sharks and rays at 129 stations. The frequency of occurrence of species usually discarded by fishers such as the Arabian carpetshark (Chiloscyllium arabicum) and stingrays (Himantura spp.) was high, accounting for 60.5% of observed elasmobranchs. Despite the large survey area covered and extensive sampling effort, the relative abundance of sharks and rays was low at 0.28 elasmobranchs per hour, 0.13 sharks per hour, and 0.15 rays per hour. This CPUE was reduced to one of lowest recorded abundance on BRUVS from around the world when removing the two discarded species from the analysis (0.11 elasmobranchs per hour). These results likely reflect the intense fishing pressure and habitat loss contributing to population declines of many elasmobranchs in the Arabian Gulf.""

According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Findings provide a baseline for future work and can support the design of conservation strategies for sharks and rays in the UAE.""

Research and development,Dubai,"How far will MENA banks go in embracing digital innovation? Global Finance's Dubai conference explored various approaches to rapid change in the banking sector.

This year, Global Finance held its digital banking and innovators' conference in the United Arab Emirates. Why? Because the Middle East is on the brink of unprecedented technological change, and Dubai is where much of the transformation is cooking: from digitization of banking services, to new technologies tailored for new customers, to cutting-edge fintechs.

The September conference provided an occasion to gather some of the leaders who have already stepped into the future of digital banking. Over 200 high-profile bankers, entrepreneurs, consultants and support organizations attended to share experiences as well as discuss the challenges and growth prospects in advancing technology in the financial sector of the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA).

How far to go in adopting innovations? Whom to partner with, and how? How to fold fintech into the structure and culture of a large, complex organization, in many cases with a long tradition of its own? How to address the (inevitable) concerns of a fragmented regional regulator/ landscape? These were some of the challenges the conference addressed-along with the opportunities.

Omar Christidis, founder and CEO of ArabNet (and Global Finance's MENA Innovator of the Year) opened the conference with the latest data his teams have gathered about the state of financial technology in the MENA region. Today, there are more than 100 fintechs operating in the Middle East, he said. Since 2012, the number of specialized start-ups has been growing exponentially, with 20 new launches in 2017 alone. About a third of the region's fintechs are located in the UAE, 18% in Egypt, 16% in Lebanon and 10% in Jordan. Together, these four markets make up over 75% of the MENA fintech sector.

The UAE, Jordan and Saudi Arabia are the most mature fintech markets, with an average ticket size of$3 million to $5 million each. Lebanon and Egypt are in a relatively early stage, with average capital injections between $250,000 and $500,000. ""We expect these markets will rise as those startups mature,"" Christidis said.

PARTNERING UP

Fintechs aside, Middle East financial institutions are still reluctant adopters of digital.

""The biggest challenge banks are facing is themselves. We are not adapting as fast as we should,"" said Aref Al-Ramli, head of digital banking and innovation at Mashreq Bank. That's not to say they do not welcome the idea of innovation. While their approaches vary, most banks are looking for ways to support innovators and develop partnerships. One attraction of the bank-fintech relationship that most panelists cited is flexibility'. ""Different fintechs can help us solve different problems. You can pick and choose the right partnerships according to your needs,"" said Seham Hanif, head of digital banking, UAE, at Standard Chartered.

Day to day, however, collaboration can be difficult. Throughout the panel discussions, it became clear that wellestablished banks and upstart start-ups seldom share the same management culture or speak the same corporate language. For eager tech entrepreneurs, the banking sector simply isn't moving fast enough; while stability-conscious bankers argue for caution in taking up new systems and processes.

""You're doing a great job with your digital interface. It looks like Facebook, but you're still selling the same product,"" said Padmini Gupta, co-founder of the online financial-services platform Rise.

""Fintechs are speedy guys; but as a bank, we need to put this in a legal framework that can be approved by a regulator-and only then can we come up with a product that we can sell,"" cautioned Mohamed Farag, chief digital officer (CDO) and head of Global Transaction Services at CEB, one of Egypt's largest banks.

Integrating fintech elements is not just a technical challenge, but also a structural and cultural one. ""The change needs to result from a top-down approach. You need to reorganize the house before you can welcome the guests,"" said Serhat Yildirim of Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank.

A new entrepreneurial culture is already drastically changing the Middle East. The rapid growth in the region of venture-capital firms, accelerator programs and incubators is pushing to create an ecosystem that fosters innovation. Fintech is attracting lots of attention with the creation of dedicated operations such as FinTech Hive in the UAE; FinTech Bay in Bahrain; and the partnership between the US-based platform Plug and Play and Abu Dhabi Global Market.

Banks are now more active in promoting innovation. Some have launched their own start-up competitions or participate in creating venture-capital (VC) firms. Jordan's Arab Bank, during the conference, became the first bank in the region to announce its own $30 million fintech accelerator program and VC fund. The fund will inject some $ 1 million to $3 million into promising companies, while the accelerator offers $250,000 in funding to early-stage projects.

""Of course, what we look for are companies that will address a problem at the bank,"" Eric Modav?, executive vice president and COO a: Arab Bank, told conferencegoers. ""Were not just doing that to experiment.""

REGULATION'S BIG CHALLENGE

Most start-ups, banks and investors agreed about regulation, which they identified as their biggest challenge, especially when they are looking to scale across :he region. ""We've invested in four fintech plays out of 40,' said Walid Hanna, founding partner at Beirut-based VC fund MEVP. ""The problem has always been the lack of quality deal flow and the regulatory framework,' added Hanna.

But this is, in part, ai function of the plethora of governments and business cultures in the region and the lack of integration throughout. Max Di Gregorio, partner in the technology practice at PwC said that if the MENA region is so hard to navigate, it is because it is so diverse-over 20 countries, with huge disparities in size, market maturity, availability of capital, income levels and even internet penetration, and not even a regional bank in the Middle East.

Owais Manzoor, regional sales head at Pay Tabs, one of the Middle East's most successful start-ups, reviewed his company's experience as it works to operate in five different markets. He said that each new market requires starting from scratch in a completely new regulatory environment. For banks and companies looking to scale regionally, he added, the advice is to take it slowly, one country at a time.

In an area where Islamic finance has significant market share, fintechs must consider whether to provide Shariahcompliant services. The answer seems to be yes, if the opportunity is ripe enough.

""For us it's increasing the options. There are huge opportunities in markets like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Southeast Asia,"" said Craig Moore, founder and CEO of Beehive, a Dubai-based peer-to-peer lending platform that offers loans to small and medium-size enterprises.

""We didn't do it because we automatically though: of going global, but there is definitely a huge opportunity on the equity side,"" said Sam Quawasmi, co-founder and co-CEO of equity crowdfunding platform Eureeca. ""Whenever there is a sukuk [Islamic bond] issued, it's always oversubscribed.""

KEEP TECH SIMPLE

Financial innovation is a broad term that covers a wide range of technologies, from simple peer-to-peer lending platforms to artificial intelligence, robotics, biometrics and cryptocurrencies. Despite their credentials, the panelists admitted it can be hard to discern the bankable options.

""Sometimes there is too much new technology. There is an element of confusion with not being able to pick something quickly enough,"" said Navin Gupta, managing director of South Asia and MENA for Ripple.

""Are you ready to fail when you pick up a new technology?"" asked Abu Dhabi Commercial Banks Isaac Thomas. ""The fear of foiling and trying again is something new in the MENA region. There needs to be a change in mentalities.""

ArabNet data show payments and retail financial services stand out in both number of start-ups and value of deals, with several companies in these segments raising $10 million and above. Wealth management and digital banking are also attracting entrepreneurs and investors, but to smaller deals. ""These are early-stage investment areas one should look out for,"" said Christidis. Although a significant topic a: the conference, consensus was that technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies are not yet a priority.

""The Middle East, Africa and Asia are in the first wave of payments technology. Fintechs at focusing on how to nint and lend money' said Tanvir Shah, managing director at The Partnerships Consuldng. This is where the added value is?'

State security measures/policies,Abu Dhabi,"Jan. 13 -- His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, received on Saturday at Al Shati Palace in Abu Dhabi the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is currently visiting the UAE as part of a regional tour.

Sheikh Mohamed welcomed the US Secretary of State and discussed with him ways to enhance ties of friendship and cooperation between the UAE and the United States, as well issues of mutual interest.

During the meeting, which was attended by H.H. Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, National Security Adviser, and H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the two sides also reviewed regional and international developments and exchanged views on them. The meeting also touched on the bilateral cooperation to strengthen regional security and stability.

The meeting was attended by Dr. Anwar bin Mohammed Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak, Chairman of Abu Dhabi Executive Affairs Authority, EAA, and Mohamed Mubarak Al Mazrouei, Under-secretary of the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince's Court.

State security measures/policies,Abu Dhabi,"A recent summit between the leaders of Turkey and Qatar brought the two regional allies closer together.

Strengthened alliance - The Turkish-Qatari alliance received a boost when Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani at the presidential palace in Ankara on November 26. The two leaders were accompanied by their entire security staffs, notably representatives of their respective intelligence services, Turkey's MIT (Milli Istihbarat Teskilati) and Qatar's State Security Bureau (SSB).

In a three-hour meeting only interrupted by two short breaks, the two sides sealed even closer cooperation between their security services. They are working together to secure the 2022 Soccer World Cup in Qatar. Ankara's deployment of soldiers in Qatar has also increased.

Joint effort against Abu Dhabi - In diplomatic terms, according to some Arab diplomats in Ankara, the two countries have also teamed to limit the influence of the United Arab Emirates. Engaged in a crusade against the Muslim Brotherhood and anyone who has anything to do with the organisation, starting with the Turkish and Qatari leaders, Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (MBZ) is perceived as their enemy number one in the region. A battle for influence in traditional and online media has been raging for months, fuelled by the hacking of officials' emails (IOL 816). Erdogan would like to see a distancing between the UAE and Saudi Arabia, where he considers MbZ to have too much influence. For this reason, he insisted that Riyadh be handled gently over the Khashoggi affair, in contrast with the Emir who sees the situation as an opportunity to put pressure on Saudi Arabia.

Winning Washington's favour - Ankara and Doha also want to distance themselves from Tehran, which is in conflict with the Trump administration. Both are on the same wavelength when it comes to the US, with whom they would like to strengthen their ties at a time when Saudi Arabia is out of favour with Congress.

FocusDoha and Ankara target small emiratesTo weaken Abu Dhabi, the two allies are prepared to go for its Achilles' heel, its relations with the rest of the federation's emirates. Dubai and Sharjah are thought to be a lot more receptive to joint economic operations which would have the advantage, for Turkey and Qatar, of isolating the Al Nahyan's emirate. Abu Dhabi's regional strategy is also not to the liking of some of the other emirates. Its engagement in the war in Yemen was a catalyzer to the internal opposition. While military options are decided by Abu Dhabi, the smaller, poorer emirates provide most of the regular troops and have suffered the biggest human losses (IOL 749).Military and commercial opportunitiesTurkey is also hoping that its diplomatic-security alignment with Qatar will open up opportunities for its defence industry, which has been struggling in other Gulf countries, precisely because of its relationship with Doha. Turkish defence companies such as SSTK, the Turkish part-public agency in charge of military high technology, have launched a number of projects with the new Qatari defence holding company Barzan Holdings (IOL 816).Libya and YemenWhile the synergies on the ground are already numerous, the two allies have recently established a joint mechanism for their involvement in Libya and Yemen.

State security measures/policies,Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi, Nov.28 (BNA): The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation issued a report showcasing its 2018, marking the 47th National Day. The UAE's 47th National Day coincides with the centenary of the birth of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, as President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa bin Zayed dubbed 2018 the ""Year of Zayed"".

The late Shaikh Zayed was renowned for his wisdom and vision, his role and his policies in building the country, achieving development, strengthening its economy and national security, and leading it on the path towards a prosperous future, the report added.

MOFAIC went on to state that the values of the late Sheikh Zayed laid the foundations of modern cultural and developmental renaissance in the country. ""Inspired by these values, the wise leaders of the country took to building a bright future for the UAE, strengthening its stance among the countries of the region and the world, turning it into an oasis of peace and political stability, economic and social development, and tolerance,"" it added.

The UAE has championed the values of tolerance and multiculturalism, rejecting discrimination and hatred by adopting nationwide programmes in partnership with various local, regional and international bodies. Today, the UAE forges ahead, a model of tolerance and acceptance, with more than 200 nationalities living in harmony, choosing it as their second home. The law guarantees residents, similarly to nationals, enjoys the right to use the state's healthcare, educational, cultural and entertainment facilities without any discrimination.

The Ministry went on to note that the UAE has appointed a Minister of Tolerance, to promote the values of tolerance and peaceful co-existence, and support moderate religious discourse. ""The country adheres to several international conventions on tolerance, coexistence and rejection of violence and extremism, including but not limited to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination of 1974, and the UAE has adopted many legislation, measures, initiatives and measures that contribute to the promotion of a culture of tolerance at the national level, including the Combating Discrimination and Hate Law, which includes articles criminalising discrimination between individuals or groups on the basis of religion, sect, race, color, origin, or the exploitation of religion in atonement, or financially supporting terrorism.""

The UAE is also active in the fight against extremism and terrorism, MOFAIC affirmed in its report, adding that the fight against terrorism and extremism is a critical element in the UAE's efforts to ensure its national security and enhance international security.

""The country has accomplished key achievements in this regard, both through military participation in Islamic and international alliances or through the enactment of local laws that combat terrorism and its causes, such as the Anti-Discrimination and Hatred Act and the Federal Law establishing Hedayah, the International Guidance Centre for Excellence in the Fight Against Violent Extremism, in addition to a decreed law that criminalises acts of contempt against religions and their sanctities, combating all forms of discrimination, renouncing hate speech, and criminalising discrimination between individuals or groups on the basis of religion, creed, sect, sect, race, color or origin.""

Shaikh Zayed's vision was founded on the need to build an integrated economy in successive consecutive times. It was brought to life as the country succeeded in building and developing a buzzing and prosperous business environment that is currently attractive for foreign direct investment.

The UAE ranked first among Arab countries in 2017 for its ability to attract foreign direct investment, which established its position as a strategic trade hub that provides foreign investors access to regional markets, as well as the freedom to transfer funds and profits, in addition, an effective judiciary system and legislation, neutral courts, laws and legislation that protects foreign capital, and low customs tariffs that range between zero and five percent on all goods.

Sheikh Zayed’s vision was an inspiration for the foreign policy of the UAE, which committed itself to build bridges of friendship, work and cooperation with other nations. Today, the UAE continues to support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which represent a roadmap or a specific path for building a better and more sustainable tomorrow for the world and future generations.

The country continues to devote itself to addressing significant global challenges, especially those related to poverty eradication, environmental protection, climate change, the establishment of justice and peace, supporting and promoting global progress.

Accordingly, the UAE has achieved qualitative growth across all areas. This reflected directly and clearly through several indicators, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report, which covers numerous vital areas such as quality of life, infrastructure, technology, and the adoption of business-friendly government policies.

This comes to confirm that the country perseveres in its endeavours following the long-term approach of Sheikh Zayed to achieve stability and prosperity in the country, in the region and in the world at large. For the fifth consecutive year, the UAE ranked first as the largest international donor of Official Development Aid, ODA, relative to gross national income, GNI. The country spent 1.31 percent of its GNI on foreign developmental aid in 2017, which is nearly twice the global target of 0.7 percent set by the United Nations as a global standard to measure the efforts of donor countries.

Donations made in 2017 amounted to a total ODA contribution of AED19.32 billion (US$5.26 billion), a year-on-year growth rate of 18.1 percent from 2016. Over 54 percent of the ODA was in the form of non-refundable grants to 147 countries (including 40 of the least developed countries) across the world.

The UAE continues to hold a leading position on the list of Official Development Aid (ODA) donors as a share of the Gross National Income (GNI), one of its many achievements on the international level and across various fields. These achievements are aligned with the legacy of the late Sheikh Zayed, as the UAE perseveres in its mission to serve humanity and support friendly countries while achieving economic prosperity and countering the effects of crises and disasters. The country aims to make impactful positive and tangible contributions to achieve the ultimate goals for humanity: eradicate poverty eradication and attain sustainable development by 2030. The UAE has taken the lead in efforts to combat poverty and provide foreign assistance to the needy, including the most vulnerable.

The United Arab Emirates has adopted a powerful stance in empowering women, setting new standards based on a unique model drawn from the vision of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, Founding Father of the UAE. This approach perpetuates in the current leadership’s vision for the future, whereby women stand as active partners and contributors to the country’s development process and play a vital role in raising future generations.

The UAE Constitution guarantees equal rights for women and men. The country is leading the way in many regional and global indexes on gender equality and women's achievements, education and literacy, women's employment, and respect for women among several social and economic indicators and other indicators.

The country’s constitution supports the participation of Emirati women in decision-making, a core component of economic empowerment. In December 2014, the UAE Cabinet adopted a decision imposing the appointment of women on the boards of directors of all institutions and government agencies, setting the proportion of female representation at 15 percent in government institutions.

Nine women sit on the Federal National Council for the 16th legislature, representing 22.5 percent of 40 members. Furthermore, women make up 27 percent of the new Cabinet formed in 2016 which includes nine women ministers, one of whom is the youngest minister appointed to Cabinet (23 years).

The UAE Gender Balance Council was established in 2015 as a federal agency dedicated to scaling up the UAE's efforts to achieve gender balance across all sectors nationwide, and in decision-making positions. Women are actively involved in the judiciary sector with several women judges and prosecutors, as well as a significant female presence in the police and the military.

In the diplomatic field, women currently hold 30 percent of positions in the diplomatic corps at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, which comprised 234 women employees in 2017, including women ambassadors and diplomats representing the UAE abroad.

Moreover, the UAE has made remarkable progress in reducing gender disparities in girls' education in schools and higher education, with more than 70 percent of girls graduating from universities. In the economic field and in the business world, women have set themselves as partners, making up 46.6 percent of the total workforce, holding 66 percent of the jobs of the public sector, 30 percent of which are decision-making positions. Furthermore, 23,000 businesswomen manage projects worth about US$15 billion in the UAE.

At the international level, more than 14 percent of total foreign aid contributed by the United Arab Emirates in 2016 was devoted to empowering women and girls around the world. After deducting bilateral support to government budgets, which accounts for more than half of the value of foreign aid contributed by the UAE in 2016, the proportion of assistance allotted to the promotion gender equality and women's empowerment accounts for nearly one-third of total aid.

One of the most salient indicators of the success of UAE diplomacy is the strength of the UAE passport, which in recent years has achieved consecutive leaps. In 2018, it ranked third in the world according to the World Passport Index, reaching 163 countries visa-free.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation has launched the Passport Power initiative that aims to place the Emirati passport on the list of the five most important passports in the world by 2021, upon the directives of H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.

This significant achievement reflects the recent success of the UAE diplomacy in carrying out the directives of President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, and His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, on openness to all countries around the world.

The feat also comes as a result of the efforts exerted by the UAE diplomacy to establish strategic relations and partnerships in the political, economic, commercial, cultural, scientific, educational fields in addition to partnerships in the health sector, to enhance the country’s standing internationally.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation forges ahead confidently and continuously striving to achieve its goals and purpose, with a key focus on the happiness of Emirati nationals, and on gaining a standing of consequence among developed countries in all fields.

State security measures/policies,Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, 28th November, 2018 (WAM) -- The UAE Government launched four new initiatives in a bid to develop work mechanisms in both the environment and municipality sectors in different regions across the UAE. The initiatives aim to promote the National Animal Welfare Plan, increase local agricultural and livestock production, and promote awareness about the concept of climate change and related measures amongst all entities in the UAE.

The announcement took place during the Environment and Municipalities Working Group meeting held in line with the UAE Government Annual Meetings in Abu Dhabi. The meeting aimed to mobilise efforts of local and federal entities in the UAE to reduce and anticipate the effects of climate change and achieve the readiness requirements to address them. This can be achieved by adopting procedures and laws to protect the environment, develop agricultural and livestock production, reduce biological hazards and vector-borne diseases.

Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, asserted that the UAE is making significant efforts to curb the impact of climate change and achieve sustainable economic growth, within the framework of the UAE Vision 2021 and the UAE National Plan for Climate Change 2050. These significant instruments developed an integrated national framework to unify efforts and boost cooperation between the public and private sectors, to ultimately serve the interests of the UAE on both the local and international levels.

He further commended the efforts of the Working Groups working in the UAE Government Annual Meetings, the largest national meeting of its kind, held under the leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces. He added that the main objective of these meetings is to launch strategies and initiatives that would enhance the UAE’s developmental model and foster its march towards the UAE Centennial 2071.

Al Zeyoudi pinpointed that the participation of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment in the meetings, and the related workshops focused on developing various initiatives pertaining to the environment, further enhance the UAE’s prominent stature in achieving sustainability in all sectors, promoting climate security, and supporting environment and natural resources preservation.

The initiatives included drafting a Federal Law for Climate Change, developing a Smart Early Warning System for Biological Security, setting a National Plan for Enhancing Local Agricultural and Livestock Production, and finding a Unified Framework for Controlling Stray and Predatory Animals.

Artificial Intelligence to Combat Agricultural PestsThe UAE Government aims to use artificial intelligence, AI, to combat agricultural pests; monitor crops; increase and diversify food production to enhance local food security and reduce dependence on imported food products. It also aims to support local products in markets; develop sustainable agricultural systems; shift towards technology that is suitable to the local environment; and adopt remote sensing techniques for crop growth and livestock monitoring across the UAE.

Smart Early Warning System for Biological SecurityThe Smart Early Warning System for Biological Security initiative seeks to develop a nationwide smart e-system that documents reports pertaining to animal diseases, agricultural pests, notifications related to local and imported foods and biological security. This aims to provide a national platform for all community members to report cases of disease outbreaks, agricultural pests or food-related incidents.

The platform will include representatives from the Ministry and other relevant entities to follow up on reports about animal diseases, agricultural pests or food-related incidents. It will also unify reporting procedures, accelerate collection and documentation of relevant information and take the appropriate actions related to enforcing or lifting bans.

A National Plan for Enhancing Local Agricultural and Livestock ProductionThe UAE Government also launched the National Plan for Enhancing Local Agricultural and Livestock Production initiative in a bid to prepare a unified and accurate database for agricultural and livestock production and unify agricultural and veterinary guidelines. It also aims to enable farmers and livestock breeders to manage agricultural and livestock production in a way that preserves sustainability of natural resources and yield commercial benefits to cover a substantial part of local consumption.

Federal Law for Climate ChangeThe Climate Change Federal Law initiative involves drafting a federal law that keeps pace with anticipated climate change challenges and their implications on the social and economic sectors.

State security measures/policies,Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, UAE, Nov. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- As Chair of the Anti-Illicit Trade & Brand Protection Summit in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), David M. Luna, President and CEO, Luna Global Networks & Convergence Strategies LLC underscored how global illicit trade threatens the economic and national security of countries all around the world. Attending the Global Trade Development Week (GTDW) event on Nov. 20-21 in UAE, Mr. Luna underscored how illicit trade is a threat multiplier that can impede the international community's collective efforts to fight corruption, organized crime, and terrorism.

In attendance and providing keynotes were His Excellency Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansoori, Minister of Economy, UAE; H.E. Secretary-General Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD); Malek Hannouf, Chairman, Gulf Brand Owners Protection Group, (BPG), and Head of Intellectual Property Department, Middle East & Africa, Louis Vuitton (LV); and Tarkan Demirbas, Vice President for Middle East, Philip Morris International (PMI).

Chris Clague, Managing Editor, and Global Editorial Leader, Trade and Globalization, The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and Jeff Hardy, Director-General, Transnational Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade (TRACIT) also participated at the GTDW conference and briefed on the 2018 Global Illicit Trade Environment Index and specific policy recommendations related to the UAE market.

At the inaugural GTDW Anti-Illicit Trade workshop in Shanghai, China in July 2018, Luna Global Networks was proud to work with numerous partners from across the public and private sectors to launch an Anti-Illicit Trade Alliance, to strengthen networks and find innovative ways to help protect our economies, markets, and communities against the harms and impacts posed by the global illegal economy.

Since that time, Luna Global Networks has continued to work with many champions across regions, sectors, and industries to harness the requisite energies to strengthen cross-border cooperation to address today's fundamental transformation of illicit trade, through a network of networks where dynamic collaborations, strategic alliances, and collective action are helping to elevate the shared global resolve to more effectively combat illicit markets.

""For the reality is that no one economy or industry is immune from illicit trade and convergence crime,"" said Mr. Luna.

Numerous international organizations have estimated that today's global illicit markets, and various forms of ""convergence crime"", account for several trillions of US dollars every year, to include the trafficking of drugs, humans, arms, counterfeit and pirated goods, illegal cigarettes and alcohol products, endangered wildlife, pillaged natural resources, and many other illicit commodities, corrupt proceeds and illicit financial flows.

""This is simply a staggering amount and a menacing threat to our public health and safety,"" emphasized Mr. Luna.

Fake water (bottles) and foodstuff add a heightened public human security dimension, as do counterfeit medicines, auto parts, and other illegal fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) that are toxic and deadly.

""Of equal concern is not only the current breadth and scale of today's illicit markets, but that many of them will double within five years' time alone, and the fact that criminals are diversifying their illicit portfolio to finance other threats,"" stated Mr. Luna.

Building on the leadership and work of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and its Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade, in a 2017 report by the International Chamber of Commerce's Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy (BASCAP) and the International Trademark Association (INTA), it is projected that the global economic value of counterfeit and pirated goods alone will reach close to $3 trillion by 2022.

Internet online shopping and cybercrime also present a threat to companies and consumers alike. It is expected that the financial costs from cybercrime will double from $US 3 trillion in 2015 to $US 6 trillion by 2021.

On Free Trade Zones, Mr. Luna also emphasized that in too many parts of the world, FTZs are exploited on a daily basis by some to facilitate illicit activities that produce broader market reputational harm and put the physical security of many communities in danger.

""The UAE has taken many positive steps to fight illicit trade,"" said TRACIT Director-General Jeffrey Hardy during his GTDW presentation. ""But persisting vulnerabilities in the country's Free Trade Zones--including Jebel Ali, the world's 9th the world's ninth busiest container port--undermine achievements to date.""

On illicit cigarettes, with the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (the ""Protocol"") taking effect earlier this year, Mr. Luna encouraged countries to sign and ratify the Protocol to address the cross-border challenges posed today by illicit networks and to commit to be part of a global enforcement regime to tackle the illegal tobacco trade globally.

Reinforcing the keynote by Minister Al Mansoori that new UAE laws will help to fight fraud and illicit trade, Mr. Luna stressed that ""we can also learn from our UAE partners from their economic policies that promote innovation to modern and smart policing and enforcement that are innovative such as the UAE approach to cybercrime as Interpol Secretary Jurgen Stock underscored a few days ago in Dubai.""

""Through such collaborative efforts including here this week in the Abu Dhabi, we can do more together to combat illicit trade at all levels across global security landscapes.""

Serving 24 million passengers per year, AUH is one of the fastest growing hubs in the world and it is anticipated that the annual passenger throughput will grow to 45 million passengers within the next 10 years. Integrated with DTP’s desk planner solution, the Xovis Passenger Tracking System (Xovis PTS) will allow Abu Dhabi Airports, the operators of Abu Dhabi International Airport, to improve passenger flow and reduce waiting-time in critical areas like check-in, security, immigration and baggage-claim, dynamically manage airport resources and ultimately increase capacity and passenger satisfaction.

Commenting on the decision to partner with DTP and Xovis, Abdul Majeed Al Khoori, Acting Chief Executive Officer at Abu Dhabi Airports said: This project has been key in meeting the growing challenge of balancing the increased volume of passengers and operational efficiency. With the implementation of this smart technology solution provided by experts such as DTP and Xovis, the team will be able to anticipate and respond to traveller flows for better real time and planning decisions. The intelligence that the system is delivering has already proven its value by providing actionable information and real time inputs during recent Low Visibility Operations.”

After a successful trial at a check-in area in Terminal 3, DTP, using Xovis’ Smart IoT Technology, has deployed 455 Xovis 3D sensors in 19 sites in T1, T1A and T3. DTP was in charge of the turnkey project management, including sensors installation, provision of infrastructure and integration between the Passenger Flow Management solution and different airport and airline’s operational systems. We have designed and implemented a Desk Planner module, that enables the airport to forecast desk demand” for security and immigration areas. Moreover, we analyze and layout the collected data and KPIs on interactive airport maps to allow the airport operations to react with necessary measures against any challenges in the passenger flow that might arise, in a timely manner. Finally, we have provided several business intelligence tools that empower airport managers to monitor SLAs and performance of different teams (Operations, Airport Services, Security and Immigration) that are involved with the passengers’ flow,” explained Abdul Razzak Mikati, managing director at DTP.

The installations at AUH strengthen Xovis’ position as leading provider of people flow monitoring solutions in the region. After Dubai and Doha, we welcome Abu Dhabi to the Xovis family.

State security measures/policies,Dubai,"Digital security supplier InfoWatch has opened a cyber security training centre to focus on developing best practices, skills transfer and knowledge sharing to bridge a skills gap in the Middle East.

Cyber security company InfoWatch Group unveiled the Digital Technology and Cyber Security Training Centre in Dubai to instigate training by introducing knowledge sharing and skills transfer.

According to the supplier, the training hub will serve the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) market by equipping candidates that undergo the training with digital technology and cyber security skills. It said the Dubai training hub supports its commitment to enhance skills by bridging the skills gap in the MENA market through bespoke digital security training programmes.

The Dubai facility has been designed to replicate InfoWatch Groups flagship training hub in Moscow and is aimed at local government officials and business executives, students from field-specific universities and channel partners, the company stated.

Kristina Tantsyura, managing director, InfoWatch Group Middle East, said: Since our regional head office, we have strengthened our relations with existing clients in the Middle East including the Central Bank of Bahrain, Prime Ministers Court of Bahrain, First Energy Bank B.S.C. Bahrain, Venture Capital Bank (Bahrain), Kuwait Finance House, Petrochem UAE, and Haward Technology.

Moreover, we have been actively piloting our solutions for a number of new large customers.

Tantsyura added that: One of the most important achievements for us was the signing of the memorandum of understanding with the Ajman Digital Government and Ajman University on cooperation in information and cyber security and the development of joint digital security educational programmes.

For most enterprise organisations in the Middle East, the technical skills of some of their most valued workers pre-sales engineers, system designers, solutions architects, developers and customer support personnel can become obsolete in almost no time. And when they do become obsolete, so can the business.

One way organisations in the Middle East are sharpening their employees IT skills and maintaining their technology edge is by taking advantage of the training and certification opportunities offered by the IT suppliers.

Tantsyura said cyber security is a pressing issue for both businesses and government agencies worldwide, and in the Middle East market its not different, and thats why InfoWatch decided to open the Digital Technology and Cyber Security Training Centre to pay special attention to educational projects through customised training initiatives.

We have created a complete set of training programmes for clients of all sizes, she said.

She pointed out that apart from the training hub, InfoWatch has launched a new consulting practice in the Middle East market that is helping customers to perform data classification and develop information security policies tailored to their specific needs and requirements.

Tantsyura explained that the centre will enable customers big or small to educate their employees, from system administrators to information and cyber security executives. She said the company will on an ongoing basis engage IT security experts and professors from InfoWatchs partner universities that specialise in areas being most demanded at the moment, such as blockchain, data science, internet of things and artificial intelligence.

State security measures/policies,Dubai,"The new initiative is aimed at giving transit passengers time to enjoy the airport facilities.

(File photo)

A new proposal has been submitted to the UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) whereby transit passengers will be able to head straight to duty free shops and other outlets at the airport without going through any procedures, said a senior official on Tuesday.

Colonel Humooda Belsuwaida Alameri, assistant director-general for operations at the General Department of Airports Security, Dubai Police, said this service will only be for transit passengers as they will be pre-screened at their destination of origin and hence will have pre-clearance when they land at the UAE's airports.

He said most passengers are transit - around 70 to 75 per cent - and this new initiative ""will give them time to enjoy the airport facilities, go for shopping at the duty free outlets and not be nervous because most passengers are nervous at the security point.""

""We are waiting for the GCAA to regulate this initiative. If approved by the GCAA, transit passengers will not to go through security and will move straight from flight to duty free without going through any procedures.

""It takes some time for passengers for clearance at the security point and catching the other flight; so the time spent at the queue for security checks can be used at duty free or have a breakfast at the outlets inside the airport,"" he said.

Alameri was speaking on the second day of the Airport Show at the Dubai International Convention and Exhibition Centre.

He elaborated that once approved by the GCAA, this initiative should be implemented across the country as it will improve revenue at the duty free as well as better help use human resources.

Alameri pointed out that this project will be applicable only for those transit passengers who are coming from countries where the standard of security is very high.

He revealed that this system will be implemented after auditing and being certified by the regulator and security agencies in the country.

""Dubai Police has plans to coordinate its human resources and capabilities to ensure security at airports. The airport security challenges are land side security, cyber security and security check points. Airports, the police and the security agencies need to collaborate and exchange information as well as do risk assessments to ensure security on all fronts,"" he added.

Express News Service

Malappuram IN Calicut International Airport there are spots, which are bereft of CCTV coverage. The major lapse in security was once again brought into the limelight when a group of expatriates complained their valuables went missing while they arrived at the airport from Dubai on Tuesday. Some video clips went viral on social media in which passengers alleged mobile phones, gold and money were stolen by airport employees. They alleged valuables were stolen at the spots which are without CCTV coverage. Two weeks ago, a check by Karipur police found some spots had no CCTV. “We found the stretch through which baggages are carried to the airport term i n a l f rom flights without CCTV,” said Karipur Sub Inspector Harikrishnan K B. The police had issued a notice to the airport authorities seeking urgent steps to install CCTV cameras in such spots in order to ensure proper security. On an average, the Karipur police receives three complaints from passengers a month alleging loss of valuables and gadgets. Tuesday’s video showed locks and zips of baggage in an open state. The video showed one of the passengers alleging he lost his mobile phone while others complained gold and money were missing from the luggage. Last month, Naheem Mottath from Panoor in Kannur district had lodged a complaint with the Karipur police alleging he lost three mobile phones worth Rs one lakh.

“My son we n t back to Dubai after he failed to get a reply from the police and the airport authorities after one month,” said Naheem’s father Mahmood Mottath. Expatriate organisations and political parties say such incidents were repeatedly reported even after complaints are issued. “Tuesday’s incident is the latest in the series. Various organisations and people’s representatives receive two or three complaints a day from expatriates alleging they have lost valuables,” said Youth League state secretary Mujeeb Kaderi. The police and airport authorities put the blame on other airports saying valuables go missing from the airport. Mujeeb said a query by Kerala Muslim Cultural Centre (KMCC) found no such complaints are reported in any other airport. “Authorities say employees in Dubai airport steal valuables. But, we found passengers from Dubai to other airports coming up with no such complaint,” Mujeeb said. Last year, one airport employee was arrested by Karipur police for stealing a gold chain from passenger’s baggage. YOUTH LEAGUE TAKES PROTEST MARCH In the wake of the incidents, Youth League Malappuram district committee took out protest march to the airport on Tuesday. The march, which started from Haj House premises, sought immediate steps to ensure security for passengers and their baggage. The march was attended by district functionaries Anwar Mullampara, K T Ashraf, Gulam Hassan Aalamgir and V K M Shafi.

Ownership changes,Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, 10th February, 2019 (WAM) -- Louvre Abu Dhabi has acquired a rare oil sketch Head of a young man, with clasped hands: Study of the figure of Christ, ca. 1648–56 by Rembrandt van Rijn (1606–1669), one of the most celebrated artists of the Dutch Golden Age. Painted on oak panel in the Dutch Republic (now the Netherlands) and identified as the Master’s work in the 1930s, it belongs to a series of oil sketches referred to as Rembrandt’s Face of Jesus group. Head of a young man was purchased by Louvre Abu Dhabi in December.

This masterpiece is the first work by Rembrandt known to have been acquired for a public collection in the Gulf region. It appeared recently in exhibitions at the Musée du Louvre, Paris; Philadelphia Museum of Art; Detroit Institute of Art; and Rembrandt House Museum in Amsterdam. It will make its first appearance at Louvre Abu Dhabi in the exhibition Rembrandt, Vermeer & the Dutch Golden Age: Masterpieces from The Leiden Collection and the Musée du Louvre before joining Louvre Abu Dhabi’s permanent collection.The acquisition of this rare masterpiece follows the unveiling of 11 new additions to Louvre Abu Dhabi’s permanent collection in October 2018. In keeping with the museum’s mission to highlight cross-cultural connections in a variety of forms, last year’s acquisitions include a range of exquisite objects from around the world and the region, including a monumental Buddhist sculpture from China (11th-12th CE), four tapestries from French royal manufacturers depicting The Hunts of Maximilian, the Duke of Brabant, as well as a rare Ottoman horse armour (15th-16th CE).

Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, Chairman of the Department of Culture and Tourism – Abu Dhabi (DCT Abu Dhabi), said: ""Rembrandt is one of the most prominent figures in Western art history and this acquisition yet again highlights the remarkable quality of both Louvre Abu Dhabi’s permanent collection and its exhibitions programme. We look forward to seeing this work unveiled at the museum and confidently look to the future, as we continue to grow our collection and inspire cross-cultural understanding in visitors from all over the world.""Manuel Rabaté, Director, Louvre Abu Dhabi, said: ""Rembrandt was one of history of art’s greatest storytellers, with an exceptional ability to capture the human soul in his artworks. With this latest acquisition, the first ever Rembrandt joining a museum collection in the Gulf, our visitors can experience the power of his creations first-hand, initially in our opening exhibition for 2019 and following that in our galleries. It will join the 650 artworks of the museum’s collection from cultures around the world, celebrating the universal creativity of humanity"".

Dr. Souraya Noujaim, Scientific, Curatorial and Collections Management Director, Louvre Abu Dhabi, added: ""We make each new addition to Louvre Abu Dhabi’s expanding collection with great rigor and care, in order to deepen and enhance the museum’s universal narrative. This exceptional work reflects the new cultural perspectives that emerged during the Dutch Golden Age due to international trade expansion and exchange of ideas. It also demonstrates the great Master's understanding of the fragility and intense spirituality of life, which inspired so many artists after him.""The Dutch Golden Age was a brief period during the 17th century when the new Dutch merchant republic, freshly independent from the Spanish Crown, was regarded as the most prosperous state in Europe. Worldwide trade led by the Dutch East India Company, combined with military advancements and new developments in art and science, gave the Low Countries (the coastal region of northwestern Europe, consisting of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) an important advantage throughout Europe and the world. Major commissions brought Vermeer and Rembrandt to the forefront of a new artistic movement, in which Protestant workers developed new themes and iconographies depicting a more realistic daily life.

In Head of a young man, the face of the black-haired man seems to be both illuminated and rendered through large brushed gestures. The same model appears in a series of studies and works by Rembrandt that was created during the same period as the artist’s renowned Supper at Emmaus (Paris, Musée du Louvre, ca. 1648).

Head of a young man is one of the finest examples of Rembrandt’s seven surviving oil sketches from the Face of Jesus group. When viewed with the other surviving sketches, it reveals the way in which Rembrandt could find the best angle or profile to use light to portray Jesus ""after life,"" with the model probably coming from the local Jewish community.

The portrait and subject matter show a new representation in the Christian world. The clasped hands emphasise narrative not distinguishable at first glance. And Rembrandt chose to represent a man in prayer, rather than a king, expressing in an ecumenical way the humble humanity of man.

The exhibition Rembrandt, Vermeer & the Dutch Golden Age: Masterpieces from The Leiden Collection and the Musée du Louvre is co-curated by Blaise Ducos, Chief Curator of Dutch and Flemish paintings at the Musée du Louvre and Lara Yeager-Crasselt, Curator of The Leiden Collection and a specialist in 17th century Dutch and Flemish art. The exhibition will be on view from February 14 through May 18, 2019.

Roughly $140 million for the interest in the hotel, which sits on Central Park South between Fifth and Sixth avenues near Manhattan’s Billionaires’ Row, was transferred to the U.S. government around Dec. 10, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Los Angeles. A representative for the buyer, Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co., declined to comment.

The sale was made possible in November, after fugitive Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, known as Jho Low, agreed to drop his claims to the property in a U.S. forfeiture lawsuit. The Justice Department agreed that dropping the claims is no admission of wrongdoing or liability, according to a statement at the time.

The Justice Department seized Low’s stake based on allegations that he bought it with money stolen from Malaysia’s state-owned 1MDB fund. Prosecutors charged Low with conspiracy and money laundering last year in connection with the looting of 1MDB. The department had been seeking to seize almost $1.7 billion in assets it says were illegally acquired through money diverted from 1MDB, including the super-yacht Equanimity and artwork by Pablo Picasso and Jean-Michel Basquiat.

Loan Sought

In recent days, potential new lenders to the Park Lane Hotel were notified of the hotel’s ownership change, which hasn’t previously been reported. Mubadala, the Witkoff Group and partners hired the Newmark Knight Frank debt team led by Dustin Stolly and Jordan Roeschlaub to refinance the 631-room hotel, according to a document seen by Bloomberg News that shows the group is seeking a $600 million floating-rate loan.

Mubadala and Witkoff’s partners in the Park Lane Hotel are hotel manager Highgate Hotels LP and New Valley, a unit of Vector Group Ltd. A representative for Newmark Knight Frank declined to comment. Representatives for Witkoff, Highgate and New Valley didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

According to the document, proceeds will be used to pay down the existing loan, as well as for additional air rights and renovations. The value of the land is estimated to be more than $1 billion, and the hotel itself represents “the last commercial tear-down opportunity abutting Central Park South.”

The Park Lane Hotel was developed in 1967 by the late billionaire Harry Helmsley and owned by a Helmsley family trust until its purchase by Witkoff and entities affiliated with Low in 2013 for about $654 million. Later that year, Mubadala paid Low $135 million for a portion of his stake in the hotel.

The latest deal for a stake in the hotel follows a settlement between the Justice Department and Red Granite Pictures Inc., which resulted in the producer of “The Wolf of Wall Street” paying $60 million to settle claims it financed the move with cash siphoned from 1MDB. It also follows Sony Corp.’s acquisition of EMI Music Publishing. Low’s proceeds from that deal are being held by the U.S. pending the outcome of the forfeiture litigation, and could be joined by the proceeds from the sale of other assets, including a Bombardier Global 5000 jet in Singapore.

The civil forfeiture lawsuits, numbering more than a dozen, were stayed in 2017 at the Justice Department’s request to protect its criminal investigation of Low and his accomplices. They remain on hold, with the exception of cases that were resolved last year.

Early on Tuesday, Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment said it sold 34.9 million AMD shares, and plans to convert 75 million warrants into equity shares.

""We remain amongst the company's top shareholders and are proud of our continuing partnership with AMD,"" the state fund said on its verified Twitter account[https://twitter.com/Mubadala/status/1092719684800135169].

Ownership changes,Abu Dhabi," 


Fitch Ratings-London-04 February 2019: Fitch Ratings has affirmed UAE-based Al Hilal Bank's (AHB) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and Short-Term IDR at 'F1'. The rating Outlook is Stable. The Viability Rating (VR) is unaffected. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary.

The rating actions follow the announcement made by Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) on 29 January 2019 that it has agreed to a three-way merger with Union National Bank (UNB) and AHB, with the latter becoming a fully owned subsidiary of the post-merger bank formed as a result of the ADCB and UNB combination. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval. The VR is unaffected as AHB will remain an operating subsidiary of ADCB. Fitch will review the VR if there are any developments in capital, asset quality, company profile or other factors as a result of the three-way combination.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

- IDRS, SUPPORT RATING (SR) AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR (SRF)

- AHB's IDRs, SR and SRF are currently driven by an extremely high probability of support from the UAE and Abu Dhabi authorities if needed. This is based on the bank's full ownership by the Abu Dhabi government, which offsets its lower systemic importance in the UAE. Fitch believes the probability of support from the UAE and Abu Dhabi authorities will not change prior to the acquisition of AHB by ADCB (expected in 2Q19-3Q19). Fitch believes AHB will be a key and integral part of the group post-acquisition.

Fitch's view of support factors in the sovereign's strong capacity to support the banking system, sustained by sovereign wealth funds and on-going revenue mostly from hydrocarbon production, despite lower oil prices. Fitch also expects high willingness from the authorities to support the banking sector. This has been demonstrated by the UAE authorities' long track record of supporting domestic banks, as well as by the authorities' close ties with and part-government ownership links to a number of banks.

AHB's SRF is at Abu Dhabi banks' SRF for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIB) of 'A+. Abu Dhabi banks' D-SIB SRF is one notch higher than other UAE banks due to Abu Dhabi's superior financial flexibility.

SPV AND SENIOR DEBT

- The ratings of senior unsecured debt (Sukuk) issued by AHB's special purpose vehicle (SPV), AHB Sukuk Company Ltd, are in line with the bank's Long -Term IDR because Fitch views the likelihood of default on any senior unsecured obligation issued by the SPV the same as the likelihood of default of the bank.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

- IDRS, SR AND SRF

- AHB's IDRs, SR and SRF are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of the creditworthiness of the UAE and Abu Dhabi authorities and of their propensity to support the banking system or the bank.

Once the acquisition is complete, Fitch will change its support analysis from sovereign to institutional, and will withdraw AHB's SRF. Significant management independence from the group, low level of integration, weak performance and low strategic importance of AHB for the group may then result in notching from the parent, although Fitch considers this unlikely.

Ownership changes,Abu Dhabi,"Dubai: Leading credit rating agencies have confirmed that the three-way merger of three Abu Dhabi banks, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), Union National Bank (UNB) and Al Hilal Bank will be neutral on the merged entity.

Moody’s has affirmed the local and foreign currency long-term and short-term deposit ratings of ADCB (ADCB) at A1/P-1, UNB at A1/P-1 and Al Hilal Bank PJSC (AHB) long-term and short-term issuer ratings at A2/P-1.

Despite the integration challenges that Moody’s expects ADCB, the surviving entity from the merger of ADCB and UNB to face, the rating agency considers that the merger is credit neutral given the similar and complementary credit profiles of ADCB and UNB. The outlook on all banks’ long-term ratings is maintained at stable.

Likewise, Moody’s expects the acquisition of AHB by the merged entity to be broadly credit neutral for AHB as the expected, improvement in its credit profile, very high parental support and very high government support all balance the loss of direct shareholding from the Abu Dhabi government through the Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC).

Fitch Ratings has affirmed UAE-based Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank’s (ADCB) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating at ‘A+’ with a Stable Outlook and Viability Rating at ‘bb+’ following the recent announcement the merger.

Fitch’s view of support factors in the sovereign’s strong capacity to support the banking system, sustained by sovereign wealth funds and ongoing revenue mostly from hydrocarbon production, despite lower oil prices. Fitch also expects high willingness from the authorities to support the banking sector.

This has been demonstrated by the UAE authorities’ long track record of supporting domestic banks, as well as by the authorities’ close ties with and part-government ownership links to a number of banks.

Ownership changes,Abu Dhabi,"Eni has been growing its Middle East portfolio through a number of agreements signed in early 2019. It has expanded its presence in the United Arab Emirates following the acquisition of a 70% stake in offshore blocks 1 and 2. Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production Company (PTTEP) holds the remaining 30% stake. The two blocks are the first to be awarded as part of Abu Dhabi’s first-ever open block licensing round, held in April 2018.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has an option to hold a 60% stake, following a commercial discovery. Under the terms of the agreements, Eni will operate the concessions and invest with PTTEP over $230mn to explore for oil and gas and appraise the existing discoveries in the two blocks. The exploration phase of the agreement has a maximum period of nine years and, subject to successful exploration, an overall concession term will extend to 35 years for development.

Eni has also signed exploration concessions for onshore Areas A, B and C in the Sharjah Emirate. It will act as operator of Areas A and C, holding a 75% participating interest, with SNOC acting as partner with a 25% stake. Meanwhile, SNOC will act as operator of Area B, holding a 50% participating interest, with Eni holding the remaining 50%.

In addition, the Italian company has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to explore in Block 1 offshore northern Bahrain, and an E&P sharing agreement for Block 47 onshore Oman. Eni will be the operator of Block 47, holding a 90% participating interest, with OOCEP holding the remaining 10%.

Exploration operations are expected to commence in 2019. Furthermore, Eni and BP have signed a head of agreement (HoA) that sets up the principles for the acquisition of the E&P rights for Block 77 onshore Oman, located 30 km east of the BP-operated Khazzan field.

• Eni has also acquired from Caelus Natural Resources a 70% stake in, and operatorship of, the Oooguruk oil field in Alaska. The acquisition provides 7,000 b/d of oil and offers important operational synergies with its nearby 100% owned and operated Nikaitchuq field. Eni already owns the remaining 30% working interest in Oooguruk, located in the Beaufort Sea. The company plans to drill further production wells at Oooguruk and Nikaitchuq, aiming to increase its total Alaskan output beyond 30,000 boe/d.

Ownership changes,Abu Dhabi,"The boards of Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Union National Bank (UNB) have agreed to merge, alongside Al Hilal Bank. The merger will enable the trio to become the third largest bank in the UAE and the fifth largest in the GCC.

Gaining Dh420bn ($114bn) in assets, the financial sector is increasingly looking to consolidate in order to retain a competitive edge and increase market share as the UAE continues to move away from oil and further diversify its portfolio.

""The merger of Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Union National Bank and Al Hilal bank is in line with the economic vision of the UAE and creates a strong banking group that has human capital and financial capabilities that will bolster the competitiveness of the economy and its future outlook,"" Sheikh bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE`s Armed Forces stated on Twitter.

""We bless this step that will bolster the business environment, guarantee its sustainability, support development projects and create investment opportunities in the vital sectors according to the best international standards.

ADCB shareholders will also own 28% and UNB shareholders 11.8%, according to a recent statement. Al Hilal Bank will operate as a separate entity. The merger will also deliver a combined entity of up to a million customers.

In addition to cost and revenue synergies, including cross selling opportunities, the bigger equity book of the combined entity can easily target larger projects, Chiradeep Ghosh, banking analyst at Bahrains Sico Bank informed The National.

""Greater scale will permit larger scope for financing to support the UAE`s economic agenda for diversification and growth, and more investment in the bank`s people, technology and infrastructure.

ADCB chairman Eissa Mohamed Al Suwaidi will become the Chairman of the new banking group and Mohamed bin Dhaen Al Hamli will be appointed as vice-chairman designate. ADCB CEO Alaa Eraiqat will also be appointed as group CEO.

""By building on past successes to produce an even stronger, performance-driven and customer-centric institution, the combined bank will continue to set high standards for the UAE banking sector and contribute to Abu Dhabi`s development into a global financial centre,"" said Eraiqat.

""The new bank is well-positioned to provide support for the UAE`s economic vision, and actively participate in the country`s growth and diversification.

Ownership changes,Abu Dhabi,"Jet Airways promoter-chairman Naresh Goyal is understood to have approached the Adani Group with a proposal to invest in his ailing airline, which is in dire need of funds. As is known, Jet was earlier in talks with Tata Group but it seems the talks did not lead to any concrete result with the latter keen on investing only if Goyal relinquished his control over the carrier. FE could not not confirm with the Adani Group if it has been approached by the Jet promoters with a bailout plan.

The latest development comes after earlier this month the Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways put strict conditions for infusing funds into the cash-strapped airline. Etihad, which currently holds 24% stake in Jet, has offered an investment proposition in the carrier at Rs 150 per share, a huge discount to Jet's current trading price, to raise its stake to 49% but wants exemption from an open offer.

Etihad also wanted that Goyal's stake should come down to around 22% from the current 51% and he and his family should have no role in the running of the airline. The conditions were outlined in a letter by Etihad CEO Tony Douglas to the State Bank of India chairman Rajneesh Kumar. The SBI is the lead lender to Jet.

In response to Etihad's offer, Goyal also wrote to the SBI chairman offering to invest up to Rs 700 crore in the airline as well as pledge all his shares on the condition that his stake does not fall below 25%. He also said that should it fall below 25%, he should be given a chance to raise it without having to go through the mandatory open offer.

On December 31, 2018, Jet had defaulted on a loan repayment to the consortium of banks. Sources in the know of development told FE that with lessors grounding Jet's plane due to non-payment, Goyal has begun scouting for alternate sources of funds. On Tuesday, the lessors grounded at least four of Jet's aircraft forcing the airline to cancel flights.

Adanis have earlier explored investing in the aviation space and were looking at budget carrier SpiceJet when former promoters Marans were looking for a buyer almost five years ago. Jet Airways declined comment over the development. In response to FE's query, Etihad said that it does not comment on rumours and speculation.

Jet, in a corporate announcement on Monday, informed the stock exchanges of an EGM to be held on February 21 to approve increase in its authorised share capital from Rs 200 crore to Rs 2,200 crore.

The transaction is expected to close in third quarter of 2019, subject to satisfaction of a number of conditions precedent, including clearance from UAE and other regulatory authorities. Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of State and ADNOC Group CEO, said, “We are delighted to partner with Eni and OMV in our refining business and the new trading company. Such partnerships follow our leadership’s wise guidance to unlock and drive greater value across our business. These innovative partnerships will support our ambition of becoming an international downstream leader with the flexibility to respond quickly to shifting market needs and dynamics. They will help enable our objective of unlocking even more value from every barrel of oil we produce. Working closely with our partners, we will also deliver further efficiencies across our operations and improve asset and business performance.” Eni’s CEO, Claudio Descalzi, said, ""These agreements consolidate our strong partnership with ADNOC. In the space of less than one year, we have been able to create a business hub with world class upstream operations and a material and efficient refinery capacity with further potential growth. This transaction, which allows us to enter the United Arab Emirates’ downstream sector and represents a 35% increase in Eni’s global refining capacity, is in line with our announced strategy to make Eni’s overall portfolio more geographically diversified, more balanced along the value chain, more efficient and more resilient to cope with market volatility.” The transaction implies a value of US$21,149.67 per bbl of installed refining capacity.

Ownership changes,Abu Dhabi,"The expansion of downstream businesses by Eni SpA and OMV AG, through their purchase of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.'s refining and petrochemical assets, will strengthen the companies' value chain integration, according to analysts.

State-owned ADNOC said Jan. 27 that Italy-based Eni will pay approximately $3.3 billion for a 20% stake in its Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Company while Austria's OMV agreed to pay $2.5 billion for a 15% stake in the refining unit.

The transactions complete what has been a well-flagged strategy by each company to expand their downstream businesses with an eye to the growing markets in Asia, Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said in a Jan. 28 note.

For OMV, the latest deal completes its broader strategy to spend €10 billion on acquisitions between 2018 and 2025.

In 2018, OMV announced it would acquire a concession in Abu Dhabi for $1.5 billion and purchased Royal Dutch Shell PLC's assets in New Zealand for $578 million. In 2019, the company plans to close an acquisition of a 50% stake in SEB Upstream Sdn Bhd, a joint venture with Malaysian Sapura Energy Berhad, for $500 million.

Although Fitch Ratings said Jan. 29 these deals place OMV's business profile ""strongly in the 'A' rating category,"" the ratings analysts said an upgrade is unlikely without a significant further increase in operating scale to bring OMV closer to European oil majors Eni and BP PLC.

For Eni, a key credit weakness was its weaker downstream segment compared with other European majors, Fitch said.

The increase in refining capacity through its deal with ADNOC will halve Eni's refining break-even margins to about $1.50 per barrel, while the improved integration along the value chain will better position the company for the volatile macro environment, the ratings agency said.

Following the acquisition of the ADNOC assets, the funds from operations adjusted net leverage metrics for both Eni and OMV will remain ""comfortably within expectation for the current ratings,"" Fitch said, as the companies gain ""high-quality assets in a growing market with good access to fuel export routes to Asia and Africa.""

In addition to selling the stakes in its refining unit, ADNOC signed an agreement with Eni and OMV to partner in a trading unit that will sell the refined products to international buyers.

The companies said approximately 70% of ADNOC Refining's throughput will be exported.

While most of the refined product will flow east to the growing Asian markets, there could be some synergy in moving refined product, particularly middle distillates, to Europe, where both companies have well-established marketing businesses, Gammel said.

Ownership changes,Abu Dhabi,"Jan 30 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's stock market rose on Wednesday, bolstered by petrochemicals, while Abu Dhabi was pulled down by Union National Bank and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank after announcing a three-way banking merger.

Abu Dhabi's index slid 0.5, with Abu Dhabi Commercial (ADCB) Bank losing 2 percent and Union National Bank (UNB) dropping 4.5 percent to its biggest intraday loss since May 2017.

ADCB, UNB and Al Hilal Bank agreed a merger to create the third-largest bank in the United Arab Emirates with $114 billion of assets.

ADCB will issue 0.5966 shares for every UNB share, corresponding to a total of 1.64 billion new shares issued to UNB shareholders and valuing UNB at nearly $4 billion.

""The scope for revenue synergies is restricted in our view, while post-merger the combined entity will enjoy a bigger scale in terms of its corporate balance sheet, but there will likely be customer overlap,"" Aarthi Chandrasekaran, vice president at Shuaa Capital, said.

""Additionally, funding cost optimisation is also limited given the modest availability of spare liquidity,"" she added.

Saudi Arabia's index inched up 0.1 percent with market heavyweight Saudi Basic Industries Corp gaining 0.5 percent and Banque Saudi Fransi increasing 1.1 percent.

Saudi Steel Pipes climbed 5.1 percent after announcing a 82 million riyal ($21.86 million) contract from Saudi Aramco to supply oil and gas steel pipes.

The Dubai index dipped 0.2 percent, with developer DAMAC Properties losing 1.6 percent.

The new group, of which the Abu Dhabi government owns a majority share, will offer conventional banking services under the ADCB banner, while Al-Hilal Bank will continue to offer Islamic financial services separately under the same name.

Despite maintaining its place as the United Arab Emirates' third largest financial institution, ADCB will climb to the fifth largest in the Gulf region, with assests worth AED 420 billion (USD 114 billion).

In the meantime, the three banks will continue to operate independently until the merger takes effect some time within the first half of 2019, added the statement.

After the move, the government, through the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, will own 60.2 percent of the combined bank.

Other ADCB shareholders will own 28.0 percent, and other UNB shareholders will own 11.8 percent of the combined bank. (end) bsu.sd

Ownership changes,Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi`s state oil firm said on Sunday it had signed partnership deals worth $5.8 billion with Italian oil giant Eni and Austria`s OMV, awarding them key stakes in its refining arm.

Under the agreements, Eni will own 20 percent and OMV 15 percent of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co`s ADNOC Refining, with the state firm keeping the remaining 65 percent.

The firm also announced the formation of a joint venture between the three companies to sell refined oil products on international markets, ADNOC said in a statement.

The deal values ADNOC Refining, which has a capacity of 922,000 barrels per day, at $19.3 billion, it said.

A signing ceremony in UAE capital Abu Dhabi was attended by Abu Dhabi`s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Italy`s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Hartwig Loger, Austria`s finance minister.

""These innovative partnerships will support our ambition of becoming an international downstream leader with the flexibility to respond quickly to shifting market needs and dynamics,"" ADNOC`s CEO Sultan al-Jaber said.

The deal is expected to be finalised in the third quarter of this year after securing regulatory approvals, with implementation commencing the following year.

Eni chief Claudio Descalzi said the transaction boosts the firm`s global refining capacity by 35 percent, while OMV executive Manfred Leitner said on the company`s website that the deal boosted its refining capacity grew by 40 percent.

Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz wrote on Twitter that ""today`s entry by OMV into ADNOC Refining will further strengthen our extremely close bilateral relations with Abu Dhabi.""

The wealthy emirate, one of seven states making the United Arab Emirates, holds more than 90 percent of the federation`s 98 billion barrels of crude oil reserves.

Last year, it renewed several key concession agreements with leading international oil majors to add further crude and natural gas production. In November, it earmarked $132 billion over the next five years to boost crude output capacity to four million barrels per day (bpd) in 2020 and to five million bpd a decade later. Its current capacity stands at 3.3 million bpd.

ADNOC last year approved $45 billion in deals to develop its downstream activities by raising refining capacity to 1.5 million bpd by 2025 and boosting its petrochemicals production.

Ownership changes,Dubai,"DUBAI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - British private equity firm Actis plans to instigate an investor vote from next week on its proposed takeover of one of Abraaj's biggest funds, seeking indemnity from potential legal claims against the Dubai buyout group, said a source close to Actis.

Abraaj was the largest buyout fund in the Middle East and North Africa until it collapsed last year after fallout from a row with investors, including the Gates Foundation, over the use of their money in a $1 billion healthcare fund.

A move by Actis to take control of Abraaj Private Equity Fund IV had hit a stumbling block as the British firm sought legal protection from any claims surrounding allegations of missing money, three sources close to the matter said earlier.

Actis, which has about $7.8 billion invested globally, has been in talks since at least October to reach the required threshold of 75 percent of investor support for its bid for the fund, originally valued at $1.6 billion.

Previously scheduled investor votes were pushed back, but Actis will begin a voting process from next week, said the source close to Actis.

The source said Actis already had the support of the largest limited partners for provision of indemnity against any legal claims and that the issue is surmountable because it would be manager of the fund rather than general partner.

SLOW PROGRESS

The slow progress, however, underscores the challenge facing Abraaj's joint provisional liquidators in averting a disruptive break-up of the group's $13.6 billion empire. So far only two of Abraaj's funds, focused on Latin America and healthcare, are known to have found new managers.

A failure to secure a new manager for APEF IV would lead to a dilution of the fund's value and its eventual liquidation, the three sources close to the matter said.

Indemnity clauses are common practice in acquisition deals where the buyer wants protection from potential risks, but the talks on APEF IV been complicated by alleged misuse of money within the fund by Abraaj.

Separate forensic audits by Deloitte and Alvarez & Marsal are reviewing allegations of missing money from the fund, which sources have estimated could amount to about $500 million.

Abraaj Holdings and Abraaj Investment Management filed for provisional liquidation in the Cayman Islands in June and their court-appointed joint provisional liquidators, Deloitte and PwC, are overseeing the restructuring of Abraaj’s debt.

Deloitte declined to comment.

One of the three sources said that Actis, which is also in line to take over Abraaj's Africa and South East Asia funds, has the support of the 10 largest limited partners but still needs that of the wider investor group, of which there are close to 80. The group is diverse, ranging from big Western funds to family offices and individual investors. (Editing by Ghaida Ghantous and David Goodman)

Ownership changes,Dubai,"UAE-based online classifieds website dubizzle has been fully acquired by the OLX Group, a subsidiary of South Africa-based investor Naspers, placing it at a value of $400 million, based on external calculations.

The group had bought the remaining 49% stake in dubizzle for $190m in April 2018. It had already owned a 51% controlling stake in the website after buying it in 2013 for $120m.

If dubizzle’s valuation was driven by revenues, its turnover is estimated to stand at about $40m per year. Online marketplace companies are typically valued at 10 times their revenue.

However, it is currently unknown whether the valuation was driven by revenue or if it was a pre-determined valuation at the time of the initial acquisition.

""This step is a testament to the amazing decade dubbizle had in this region. The co-founders also felt that dubizzle is in good hands to move forward to continue its development under OLX Group,” said Barry Judge, general manager at dubizzle UAE.

Dubizzle, which was founded in Dubai in 2005 to allow users to advertise goods or services, currently operates in eight countries across the MENA region including Egypt, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.

It was founded by J.C. Butler and Sim Whatley, who stepped down from the day to day running of the company in 2013 after selling the majority stake to Naspers.

Dubizzle has since acquired a number of UAE-based startups including Expat Wheels, Wecashanycar, Masterkey and Airlist.

Judge said the acquisition will not affect the company’s day to day operations, as it will continue to be run by the local management team independently.

The acquisition by Naspers is part of its plan to increase its global presence in classifieds, payments and food-delivery verticals in the MENA region.

"Crime, legal",Abu Dhabi,"FIFA is being dragged into the Gulf's internal rivalries and that does not bode well for the federation.

In late January, a British football fan[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/british-man-detained-uae-wearing-qatar-football-shirt-190205132925646.html] was arrested in the United Arab Emirates[https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-arab-emirates.html] for wearing a Qatar t-shirt at an Asian Cup match played in the Emirati capital, Abu Dhabi. Ali Issa Ahmad was allegedly unaware of a decree that could have forced him to pay a large fine and seen him jailed for up to 15 years for displaying sympathy for Qatar[https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/qatar.html]. Perhaps he also did not clock that there were no Qatari fans in the stands.

That is because in June 2017, the UAE, along with Saudi Arabia[https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html], Egypt[https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/egypt.html] and Bahrain[https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/bahrain.html], launched a land, air and sea blockade[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/qatar-diplomatic-crisis-latest-updates-170605105550769.html] of their Gulf neighbour. Qataris living in the four countries were abruptly kicked out and not allowed back. The ""no sympathy[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/uae-social-media-users-face-jail-qatar-sympathy-170607053416087.html]"" decree followed shortly thereafter.

The unfortunate fan probably also found it curious and possibly upsetting that the Qatari national anthem was drowned out by boos and that each time Qatar scored, the team was showered with verbal abuse, shoes and plastic bottles. A few days later, in a moment of karmic justice, Qatar whipped the UAE 4-0 and then went on to claim the cup[https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/qatar-wins-major-football-title-beating-japan-190201162701218.html] with another convincing win against Japan.

Rather like that fan, FIFA, I am sure, had no inkling when it awarded the 2022 World Cup to Qatar in 2010 that it was about to enter the twilight zone of Gulf politics.

Shortly after the announcement, allegations that the Qataris had bribed their way to football and sports' most prized asset started circulating. This coincided with an FBI investigation in the US of a dozen FIFA officials accused of receiving illegal payments for distributing media and marketing rights in the Americas.

More allegations were made against Qatar, which it categorically denied[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/qatar-world-cup-allegations-part-smear-campaign-171212204818674.html]. Since then, the Qataris have been assiduous in shoring up support and addressing issues concerning the World Cup. One of their biggest critics, the International Trade Union Confederation, is now onside[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/sep/06/qatar-law-change-milestone-migrant-workers-world-cup-2022-exit-permits] after Qatar agreed to dramatically improve conditions for the million migrants working on cup infrastructure.

The Qatari authorities and various media organisations have also started uncovering evidence of a premeditated smear campaign[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/16/football-and-fat-fees-questions-raised-over-funding-of-sporting-conference] against the country, aimed at revoking its award of the 2022 World Cup.

The UAE, in particular, has never quite gotten over the thought that it should have been it and not Qatar that secured the first World Cup to be played in the Arab world, despite the fact that it never got around to putting a bid in. The Qatari-Emirati rivalry started way before the 2017 blockade and dates back to the early 1970s when the two countries were established. It extends to various fields: from economy to regional politics, world standing and clout, and now even sports.

The UAE would like nothing better than to see the World Cup pulled from Qatar[https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2017/11/12/isolated-in-gulf-qatar-campaigns-to-protect-2022-world-cup/107629572/]. It has launched numerous initiatives[https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/qatar-world-cup-2022-england-campaign-khalid-al-hail-fifa/] to that effect, including fake news sites and ""independent"" reports aimed at spreading the narrative that Qatar cannot manage the cup.

Abu Dhabi has also recently stepped up its game with FIFA President Gianni Infantino. It is pushing to expand the number of teams from 32 to 48, an idea that the new FIFA president has encouraged[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/fifa-hints-expanding-qatar-2022-world-cup-wider-gulf-region-181031151713337.html]. Emirati officials have repeatedly declared that they are ready to ""cohost"" the World Cup, while Infantino has suggested that if Qatar agrees to share the matches, it could enjoy better regional relations.

In getting involved in the dispute between Qatar and the UAE, the FIFA president is going against a major principle the federation has been committed to - keeping politics out of football.

Last year, despite the diplomatic crisis between Russia[https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/russia.html] and the West, FIFA went ahead with the World Cup as planned. It also showed little tolerance for politics on the pitch. It disciplined three Swiss players for political gestures aimed at the stands and fined the Serbian Football Federation after their fans displayed ""discriminatory banners and messages"" during a match against Costa Rica. The Argentine Football Association was also slapped with a fine after its fans were involved in ""fights, throwing objects and homophobic and insulting chants"" following their 0-3 defeat by Croatia[https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/croatia.html].

Given its tough stance on these incidents, the FIFA leadership cannot overlook the unacceptable behaviour of the Emirati fans at the Asian Cup and the fact that it was very much provoked by official government views and the Emirati media whipping up anti-Qatar feeling. It should observe closely how its regional body, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) deals with the problem.

FIFA should not allow the AFC to go easy on the Emirati football authorities. The fact that the president of the AFC, Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa, is a senior member of Bahrain's ruling Al Khalifa family, which is deeply indebted to the UAE for helping keep their battered economy afloat, should not influence the confederation's decision.

With the Emiratis and the Saudis showing no interest in ending the feud with Qatar, Infantino may want to think a little more before allowing FIFA to be drawn into the dispute. The organisation he heads is still reeling from the corrupt mess left by his predecessor Sepp Blatter. His focus should be on cleaning up FIFA's Augean stables, not blithely accepting the Emirati push to expand the World Cup pool by a third in 2022. That is a political trap he and FIFA would do well to avoid.

"Crime, legal",Abu Dhabi,"Hyderabad: The National Investigation Agency on Thursday filed a supplementary chargesheet against Mohammad Abdullah Basith and Mohammad Abdul Qhadeer, arrested in August 2018 from Hyderabad for alleged links to members of the Abu Dhabi ISIS module.

NIA had booked the case in 2016 in which three persons from India, living in Abu Dhabi, formed a gang owing their membership to ISIS, a banned terrorist organisation.

During the investigation, the NIA found that Basith, a resident of Chandrayangutta, received money from an ISIS member using which he made plans to fly to Syria via Turkey.

Basith had also made two attempts to flee India, once from Kolkata and another time from Nagpur. His plans were foiled by the state's counter-intelligence wing and he was brought back to the city.

A case was also registered against Basith and two others, Maaz Hasan Farooqi and Omar Farooq Hussaini, after their failed attempt to go to Srinagar and meet Kashmiri separatist leader Asiya Andrabi.

Basith, who was counselled several times and given bail, did not change his attitude and continued with his illegal activities.

“Basith was continuously making efforts to propagate the ideology of ISIS in India for which he entered into a conspiracy with ISIS handlers and his associates,” NIA said on Thursday. “He and his associates were involved in identifying, motivating, radicalising gullible Muslim youths to join hands with him.”

It also said that “Abdul Qhadeer, a resident of Chandrayangutta, who was arrested with Basith in August in possession of explosives, came under the influence of Basith because of their common intention to propagate ISIS' ideology in India for which he actively started meeting other gang members. The recovery of explosives from his possession establishes his intention to fabricate an IED.”

Basith and Qhadeer are currently in judicial custody in Delhi. In 2016, three persons - Adnan Hussain, Mohammad Farhan and Sheikh Azhar Al Islam - were deported from the UAE for forming a new module and extending their support to ISIS and inspiring Indians to join them.

"Crime, legal",Abu Dhabi,"* Ali Issa Ahmad, 26, from Wolverhampton, was on holiday in Abu Dhabi

* He was given a ticket to the crunch Asian Cup match between Qatar and Iraq

* The UAE banned shows of symathy towards Qatar after a diplomatic dispute

* As a result people can be given fines or prison sentences for promoting Qatar

A British football fan could face 15 years in prison or a £100,000 fine after he was held in the United Arab Emirates for wearing a Qatar shirt to a football match.

Arsenal supporter Ali Issa Ahmad, 26, was on holiday in Abu Dhabi when he was given a ticket to an Asian Cup match between Qatar and Iraq.

The UAE, who were the tournament hosts, has been embroiled in a furious diplomatic row with Doha after joining a Saudi-led blockade of the country in 2017.

As a result anyone caught wearing the country's maroon shirt in public can be fined or imprisoned, with the pressure group Detained in Dubai warning the sentence could be as severe as 15 years in jail.

Following his arrest last week Ahmad, from Wolverhampton, was detained in Sharjah in the UAE.

He was allowed to phone his friend, Amer Lokie, who said: 'This is just unspeakable.

'He just went to watch a football match while he was on holiday in UAE and says he was arrested and beaten after being accused of wearing a football shirt which promoted Qatar.

'When he managed to call me officials were sitting next to him so he couldn't say too much. He wasn't given very long to speak to me and I'm not exactly sure what happened.

'It seems that he was released after being detained, assaulted by security men in the car and accused of promoting Qatar. He went to the police station to report the assault and was accused of telling lies about the incident.

'We're not clear about exactly what happened next but he has been held because he is accused of making false allegations against UAE security officials.'

Lokie told The Guardian that his friend sounded scared after his iPhone had been taken off him and he'd been held for two days.

'He didn't sound good when he spoke to me on the phone. He was speaking very slowly and he sounded frightened.

'He begged us to do whatever we can to get him released so we contacted the foreign office and asked them to help get him released.

'He said he would call us back but since then we have not heard anything from him. I am in shock that he was arrested and assaulted because of the football shirt he was wearing. We are all so worried about him. This is very serious'.

Radha Stirling, CEO of Detained in Dubai, , said: 'It is outrageous that the UAE would politicise football to the point that a foreign fan with no political or ideological allegiances in the ongoing regional dispute would be arrested for literally nothing more than wearing a shirt for the 'wrong' team.

'The police have apparently escalated the charge against Ali from 'showing sympathy for Qatar' to now 'making false allegations against UAE security officials'; which could potentially be treated as an act of sedition and thus a national security crime.

'Both the initial arrest and the escalation of charges are clearly politically motivated acts by the police; and Ali is being victimised merely to send a signal to Qatar in the run-up to the World Cup.

'This is a gross violation of his rights, and the only signal it sends to the international community is that the UAE is an unsafe destination.'

The Foreign Office is warning tourists that showing sympathy for Qatar on social media or otherwise is an offence punishable by a fine of imprisonment.

In June 2017 Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt launched a diplomatic and transport blockade of the tiny Gulf state accusing it of cosying up to Iran and supporting terrorism, which Doha denies.

On Friday Qatar lifted the Asian Cup after beating Japan in the Final. It was the first time the country had won the competition – the Asian equivalent of the Euros.

Qatar fans stayed away because they are not allowed to travel directly to the UAE and feared harassment when they got there. But many local Kuwaiti and Omani football fans did support the team.

Things turned sour, however, when Qatar beat Saudi Arabia in the Group Stage and UAE in the semi finals.

Home fans registered their displeasure by throwing sandals at the Qatari players as a sign of their disgust.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are providing assistance to a British man arrested in the UAE and are in touch with the local authorities'.

"Crime, legal",Abu Dhabi,"A gang of 24 men suspected of defrauding people through phone scams has been detained in the Capital.

The Abu Dhabi Financial Prosecutors said they have referred the Asian men to court for trial after investigations suggested that they cheated people by promising them bogus cash prizes after claiming to be working for big companies in the UAE.

Prosecutors said the suspects had made a phone call to a resident and told him that he had won half-a-million dirhams in prize money.

The men then asked him to transfer some money as processing charge for the prize to the account of one of them.

They had given the victim the number on his SIM card, telling him that it was a secret number, just to convince him that they were genuine.

When he checked he found that they number they told him was really the one on the SIM card.

Once the victim sent the money to the fraudsters, they switched off their mobile phone.

The police had initiated an investigation into the matter after the victim filed a complaint and arrested 17 men suspected of carrying out the crime.

The men gave the police information about seven accomplices who aided them in the fraud.

Prosecutors have asked people to report phone calls and messages that tell them they have won huge cash prizes and ask them to pay money to the police.

"Crime, legal",Abu Dhabi,"The investigation into alleged external interference in the US election in 2016 is no longer exclusively focussed on Russia — Saudi Arabia and the UAE are being probed, according to a report in InsideArabiaOnline.

The probe is also looking at Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for their alleged ties with the Trump campaign and relations with figures in the president’s inner circle,” the report said.

A key figure to watch is George Nader, an emissary from Abu Dhabi who cooperated with the investigation but may no longer be entitled to any leniency due to a possible violation of his plea deal. The Lebanese-American businessman played a pivotal role in setting up the controversial meeting between Erik Prince and Russian sovereign wealth fund head, Kirill Dmitriev. Nader attended a meeting between Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ), the UAE’s de facto ruler, and Trump’s son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner. He also gave $ 2.5 million from the UAE to US lawmakers in order to push anti-Qatar legislation.

The extent to which top UAE officials are unsettled by the investigation is remarkable. That MbZ has not returned to Washington since his visit to the Oval Office just before Trump departed on his first official trip to Riyadh in May 2017 is almost certainly tied to concerns about MbZ possibly being named publicly in the probe. There are other issues involving other senior leaders of the Emirati leadership who seem likely to be implicated.

Consequently, because of the Mueller investigation, and other issues too, this year will probably be problematic for Riyadh and Abu Dhabi in Washington. With the House of Representatives of the 116th Congress now controlled by anti-Trump lawmakers who will use their investigative powers in an effort to unseat the American president in what is already a vicious and ugly time in American politics, Saudi Arabia and the UAE will face new challenges with the Democrats now in charge of the House of Representatives as they push ahead with their agenda against Trump.

The murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the Yemen humanitarian disaster will be issues that Democratic lawmakers and presidential candidates highlight in their attacks on Trump’s Middle East policy, particularly regarding U.S.-Saudi relations. The detention of human/women’s rights activists in Saudi Arabia will probably receive condemnation from more lawmakers too if the Kingdom does not release these individuals soon. There’s also the case involving a Saudi national, Abdulrahman Sameer Noorah, who fled the U.S. under mysterious circumstances while in pre-trial detention and facing charges of first-degree manslaughter in Portland, Oregon. This could deepen the rift between the Trump administration and American lawmakers on the issue of Washington-Riyadh relations depending on the facts elicited during the investigation of the case.

With the Mueller investigation results prompting pundits to forecast an impeachment of Trump—on top of the possibility of a Democratic hopeful defeating him in next year’s 2020 presidential election—Saudi Arabia and the UAE should be concerned about the post-Trump era. The strong bonds that both Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) and MbZ built with Trump undermined a traditional understanding that America’s alliances with the Gulf monarchies were to be unrelated to partisanship. Put simply, the risks of becoming a partisan flashpoint in U.S. politics” never experienced before (including even during and after 9/11) will be a real test for Riyadh and Abu Dhabi which may find themselves suffering from sanctions sooner rather than later. American officials are already discussing such options.

As the Democratic party’s legislators in the House now reflect the most diverse Congress in American history, with more minorities being represented after last year’s midterm elections, the Saudis and Emiratis should look to ways to improve their standing with different constituent groups in America beyond Evangelicals, whose delegations have received a welcome in Abu Dhabi from MbZ. Unquestionably, Saudi Arabia and the UAE maintaining close ties with domestic groups in the U.S. will be important for Riyadh and Abu Dhabi’s relations with Washington after Trump leaves the Oval Office.

Yet, Saudi and Emirati media outlets have recently attacked the House of Representatives’ two newly-elected Muslim-Americans—Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Omar Ilhan (D-MN). Articles against these two politicians published by Gulf-based outlets allege that Tlaib and Ilhan maintain ties to international terror groups and work on behalf of a global Muslim Brotherhood-orchestrated campaign to remove Trump from power. It is doubtful that such language can help the Saudi and Emirati leaders build new bridges with Democrats, nor with their constituents, who might be even more empowered after next year’s election, especially as their party places greater emphasis on pride in racial, ethnic, and religious diversity. This posture contrasts mightily with Trump’s nationalist,” Islamophobic, and xenophobic narratives that Saudi Arabia and the UAE have at times somewhat supported, underscored by their response to the Muslim ban” as well as the Saudi/Emirati media reports on Tlaib and Ilhan.

During the eight years of the Obama presidency, which left Saudi Arabia and the UAE perceiving that the U.S. had abandoned them in favor of a rapprochement with Iran, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were extremely frustrated with the leadership in Washington. Yet looking ahead, it is possible that Washington’s strategic alliances with both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi could suffer as a result of how Trump has worked with MbS and MbZ to create a different type of personality-driven relationship, resulting in the Emiratis taking advantage of their friendship with Trump to further infiltrate the White House, perhaps equal to or more than the Russians have done so. Both MbS and MbZ may need to consider how to reverse the negative effects resulting from investing too much in Trump and essentially betting the farm on him.

There is a storm coming that will likely see sanction efforts against Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi’s Crown Princes and others around them that may last years. It would be negligent not to be thinking about such an outcome given the plethora of data available in open media. In the future, King Mohammed bin Salman must inevitably contend with Trump’s successor, whoever that may be. How will Saudi Arabia’s relationship with Washington look if more Democrats who are staunchly anti-Trump control both the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government? In a day and age in which both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have become quite pro-Republican, pro-Trump, anti-Obama, and, by extension, anti-Democrat, the potential for political change in America—as well as developments in the Mueller investigation—to have a heavy impact on Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s fundamental interests is real.

"Crime, legal",Abu Dhabi,"A former top aide to a powerful member of Abu Dhabi's royal family alleged from prison that he is unfairly being blamed for the United Arab Emirates' role in one of the world's biggest financial scandals, and that Emirati authorities are trying to force him to turn over his assets.

Khadem Al Qubaisi was once one of the Middle East's highflying businessmen. He helped negotiate the bailout of Barclays Bank in 2008 and a multibillion-dollar investment into Daimler AG on behalf of his boss, Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed al Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates' deputy prime minister and a member of the royal family.

Abu Dhabi authorities arrested Mr. Al Qubaisi in 2016 amid U.S. Justice Department accusations that he and several co-conspirators collectively stole billions of dollars from 1Malaysia Development Bhd., an investment fund ostensibly set up to help develop the Malaysian economy.

Mr. Al Qubaisi received $471 million of stolen funds into his private account in Luxembourg and used some of it to buy U.S. real estate, according to civil complaints by the Justice Department targeting his assets. Mr. Al Qubaisi hasn't been charged with any crime in the U.A.E. or U.S.

In his first media interview since he was imprisoned in Abu Dhabi, Mr. Al Qubaisi said from a prison phone that he is being blamed as a ""scapegoat"" by Sheikh Mansour and Abu Dhabi authorities. Sheikh Mansour is also chairman of the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department, which oversees all criminal cases in the emirate.

Mr. Al Qubaisi said authorities are pressing him to turn over his assets to a private company owned by the sheikh.

The Abu Dhabi government declined to comment. Representatives for Sheikh Mansour and Das Holding, an Abu Dhabi company he controls, didn't respond to multiple requests to comment.

An Abu Dhabi-based lawyer involved in Mr. Al Qubaisi's case said Mr. Al Qubaisi ""abused and exceeded his authorities"" at Abu Dhabi sovereign funds ""to achieve personal and illegal gains.""

""Now he is more concerned about keeping his illegal wealth than doing the right thing by admitting his guilt and returning the proceeds he obtained from his criminal activities,"" the lawyer said.

Mr. Al Qubaisi said he had acted with the knowledge of more-senior U.A.E. officials when he steered a sovereign-wealth fund he managed, International Petroleum Investment Co., to become a key business partner of 1MDB, including guaranteeing $3.5 billion in 1MDB bonds.

That deal soured when billions of dollars went missing from 1MDB.

U.S. authorities say Mr. Al Qubaisi helped funnel 1MDB money to conspirators through companies set up to look like subsidiaries of IPIC.

Mr. Al Qubaisi didn't address the specifics of the allegations in the interview.

""I did this deal but I did it on behalf of the government of Abu Dhabi,"" he said. Now ""they are putting everything on my back.""

Sheikh Mansour was chairman of IPIC at the time Mr. Al Qubaisi was agreeing to support 1MDB.

During two five-minute phone calls from Al Wathba prison in Abu Dhabi, Mr. Al Qubaisi said he hadn't been interrogated by any law-enforcement body about 1MDB deals. Instead, U.A.E. officers periodically come and pressure him to sign over his assets, including land and villas in the U.A.E., to Das Holding, he said.

He said that this month he was handcuffed to a window in a corridor and left for 24 hours.

""If I did something wrong for this Malaysia deal, OK, they can go and take my assets, no problem,"" he said. ""Why is a private company trying to take control of my assets?""

Two nephews who had power of attorney over some of his assets had been detained until they signed over $40 million in luxury cars and land to Das Holding, Mr. Al Qubaisi said. The nephews didn't respond to requests to comment.

The Abu Dhabi lawyer involved in the case said Mr. Al Qubaisi's description of his prison conditions and treatment were inaccurate.

Mr. Al Qubaisi said his plan was to ""die here in this place or to get out.""

Soon after Mr. Al Qubaisi's phone calls to The Wall Street Journal, an intermediary who set up the calls was detained and questioned by Abu Dhabi security services, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Mr. Al Qubaisi is wanted for questioning in several other countries for allegedly pilfering money from 1MDB and committing other financial crimes, according to this person. Abu Dhabi authorities haven't agreed to let him testify elsewhere.

The Justice Department is seeking to reclaim luxury homes in the U.S. that Mr. Al Qubaisi allegedly bought with funds stolen from 1MDB. The department declined to comment on the matter.

Luxembourg and Swiss authorities have frozen tens of millions of dollars in accounts controlled by Mr. Al Qubaisi and French authorities have seized real estate.

"Crime, legal",Abu Dhabi,"Public prosecutors have demanded the death penalty for a worker, who is accused of stabbing five people to death at a massage parlour in Abu Dhabi. The judge at the Abu Dhabi Criminal Court of First Instance, however, said that a verdict will be pronounced only after the victims' families inform the court if they are willing to pardon the defendant in exchange for blood money.

The Bangladeshi man is on trial for murdering a man for having paid sex with his Indonesian girlfriend and four others who worked with her at the massage parlour in the Musaffah industrial area last year.

Eight other Bangladeshi men, who knew about the murder but wanted to cover up for their friend, were also charged in the case.

Court documents stated that the Bangladeshi entered the massage parlour and found the Asian victim seated there. As his girlfriend entered another room with the four other women, the man asked the victim whether he was having paid sex with his lover. When he said yes, the defendant stabbed him with a knife several times until he died.

After that, the defendant went on to attack the four other women as they had let his girlfriend have sex with other men in his absence.

The case came to light after a worker reported to the police about a foul smell from a room in his neighborhood. When the police went to the parlour, they found the five bodies.

During the course of the investigation, the police arrested the defendant, his girlfriend and the eight Bangladeshis.

The defendant had admitted to the murder during his interrogation, but denied the charges in court.

"Crime, legal",Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, 30th December, 2018 (WAM) -- The UAE is taking concrete steps to accelerate and facilitate the development of its judicial system to play a pivotal role in enhancing the country's status as an attractive business environment. This requires facilitating access to justice through simplifying litigation procedures, in accordance with the strategic priority of enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of judicial processes and ensuring universal access to services.

In this regard, the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department, ADJD, announced on Saturday the launch of bilingual - Arabic and English - 'Interactive Claim Forms'.

The move comes in line with UAE strategy of technological development in government departments, including the judiciary, and will help to standardise court forms, and increase litigation transparency, while eliminating language barriers for expatriates, leading to a better understanding of litigation procedures, their rights and duties.

Earlier, in October, real state litigation in Dubai witnessed an unprecedented development as Rental Disputes Centre, RDC, received the registration cases through 'Court Probe' – CP1, the first innovative concept of its kind in the world, presenting the latest technology to provide unprecedented services in the field of real estate litigation.

In September, Abu Dhabi courts implemented ‘Remote Trial System’ in cooperation with Abu Dhabi Police using the Visual Communication Technology, VCT, and linking the public prosecution and criminal courts to penal and correctional facilities.

The move came as part of the department’s efforts to enhance the efficiency of litigation and ensure the effectiveness of the criminal justice system.

UAE officials stress the endeavour to pioneer the ‘smart government’ initiative globally through digital transformation and service automation. Utilising new technologies as AI and Block-chain, with an Emirati added value, it provides citizens and expats a seamlessly smart and efficient government services.

"Crime, legal",Abu Dhabi,"The Gulf has poured more than $2bn into US and UK higher education since 2012. But with the jailing of a British student in the UAE and murder of Jamal Khashoggi, critics say it is time to stop taking the money. By Andrew England and Simeon Kerr

W hen Matthew Hedges, a Durham University PhD student, set off on a two-week trip to the United Arab Emirates, he was following a tradition of British academics conducting research in the Arabian peninsula. But as he tried to leave Dubai in May he was detained, held in solitary confinement in Abu Dhabi for six months and sentenced to life in prison for spying.

His sentencing triggered a rare public spat between the UK and one of its closest Middle East allies. Both sides now appear keen to move on after the UAE pardoned Mr Hedges in November. But British academia may find it more difficult to return to ""business as usual"". The Hedges case revived western scrutiny of the Gulf — which has periodically been criticised over labour conditions and human rights abuses — and the rewarding relationship UK universities have long enjoyed with the oil-rich states.

Some US institutions are also reassessing their ties with Gulf entities in the wake of the October murder of Jamal Khashoggi by a Saudi hit squad. A preliminary report by MIT into its links with Saudi donors and sponsors found no reason to end the relationships. But Harvard has chosen not to renew a fiveyear fellowship programme with the MiSK Foundation, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's charity.

In the wake of the journalist's killing, US senators said they believed Prince Mohammed, the kingdom's de facto leader, ordered the operation against Khashoggi. Prince Mohammed has denied any involvement and Riyadh blamed it on a rogue operation.

The debate about university links to the Gulf underscores how the repercussions of the Hedges and Khashoggi cases are being felt far beyond the political and corporate worlds. For western governments, the dilemma is to appear robust in their responses to the incidents while maintaining relations with key allies. But for academics it is particularly sensitive as they seek to balance their traditional positions as defenders of human rights and freedom of expression with longstanding financial, educational and research relationships.

""It's going to make us all a lot more conscious of, and careful about, how we look for money, how we accept money,"" says William E Granara, director of Harvard's Center for Middle Eastern Studies. ""The latest incident is going to keep us all on our toes.""

Wealthy supporters Confident, assertive and keen to exert soft power, Gulf countries have been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into top academic institutions in the UK and US for years.

Between them the six Gulf states — Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman — have provided $2.2bn to US universities since the beginning of 2012 to June this year, according to a Financial Times analysis of the US education department's Foreign Gifts and Contracts Report. The Gulf total represents just under a quarter of all foreign gifts and contracts over that period. Qatar, the world's richest state in per capita terms, led with $1.3bn, followed by Saudi Arabia with $580.5m and the UAE with $213m.

The figures include funding from state oil companies, such as Saudi Aramco and Qatar Petroleum, Gulf universities and cultural missions. Much of the money also goes to student fees — Riyadh funded about 110,000 US scholarships for Saudis between 2005 and 2015. There is less transparency over foreign funding to UK institutions. But Gulf entities have donated tens of millions of pounds to the country's leading institutions, primarily to their Middle East centres. Research by academics Jonas Bergan Draege and Martin Lestra, published in the Middle East Law and Governance journal in 2015, estimated that Gulf entities provided at least £70m to UK institutions between 1997 and 2007.

Oxford university says it has received £17.7m from Gulf states since 2000, excluding donations to individual colleges, with more than £6m each from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. About 1 per cent of its total donations came from the Middle East. That also excludes funding for the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, which is described as a ""recognised independent centre"" of the university, built with a £20m donation from King Fahd, the late Saudi monarch.

Cambridge university received £8m from Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in 2008 to establish a centre for Islamic studies, and gifts totalling about £7m from Sultan Qaboos bin Said al-Said, Oman's ruler, for the establishment of two professorships.

Richard K Lester, MIT's associate provost, told the university's newsletter that his recommendation not to terminate its ties to Saudi donors was a ""tough call, because none of us wants to lend legitimacy to grotesque actions like the assassination of Khashoggi"".

""But the judgment I have made [in the preliminary report] is that, on balance, the benefits provided by the work we're doing outweigh the impact of any kind of reputational support our activities may provide to those in Saudi Arabia responsible for these malevolent actions.""

Other academics are more sceptical. ""I doubt it will be business as usual,"" says one close to the Hedges case, ""and nor should it be.""

'Sphere of influence' There is also a deeper question that some academics say needs to be asked — the extent to which Gulf funding may influence research on the Middle East, a region where some topics are taboo and critics and dissidents are jailed.

Mr Hedges was researching the sensitive subject of military development in the Gulf after the 2011 Arab uprisings.

""It's not easy to track. But if centres want to safeguard funding streams, then they might either commission research that falls within a specific remit and perhaps not commission research that doesn't, or individual academics might feel they don't wish to cross certain lines in case the funding is jeopardised,"" says Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a Baker Institute fellow for the Middle East.

Mr Ulrichsen is a former co-director of the London School of Economics' Kuwait programme on development, governance and globalisation in the Gulf states, a scheme launched with a £5.7m donation from a Kuwaiti foundation in 2007. It was renewed for another five years in 2017 with a £2.7m grant.

He says the only time he had an issue as head of the LSE programme was when Kuwaiti donors called to complain about an article he had written about protests in the Gulf state in 2012.

But a year later, Mr Ulrichsen was denied entry at Dubai airport after he wrote articles critical of Bahrain and the UAE. The LSE responded by cancelling a conference in the UAE.

Mr Ulrichsen believes ""a lot of people may self-censor"" to avoid a similar fate.

It was not the first time the LSE was plunged into a controversy over Middle East money. In 2011, as Libyans rebelled against Muammer Gaddafi, a scandal erupted at the university over £1.5m it received from the Gaddafi Foundation run by the late dictator's son, Seif al-Islam Gaddafi. The LSE's director resigned over the affair.

The LSE also received a £9m commitment in 2006, mostly from the UAE's Emirates Foundation, to establish a centre for Middle East studies, and has a £2.5m lecture theatre named after Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the nation's founder.

Professor Toby Dodge, director of that centre from 2013 to 2018, says ""we've all learnt the lessons of what you don't do"" after the Libya debacle. ""Our pluralistic, overlapping, critical research is beyond reproach,"" he says. ""It has furthered the academic study of the region, it hasn't in any way led to self-censorship.""

But, he adds, ""you have to be incredibly careful"".

Proponents of Gulf funding say universities' relations with Gulf states have enhanced academic ties, enabled the transfer of skills and fostered collaborative research. Others point to longstanding ties between Gulf royals and UK and US institutions, with many attending British and American universities, as well as military academies such as Sandhurst in the UK, which has fostered philanthropy from Arab alumni.

""UK universities are the oldest Gulf think-tanks in the world,"" says Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a UAE academic and commentator, who has defended the UAE's position in the Hedges case.

After the September 11, 2001, attacks in the US, Riyadh ramped up its foreign scholarship programme with the aim of raising the education of young Saudis and exposing them to different cultures. It was also considered an important part of the kingdom's efforts to rehabilitate its reputation through the students' interaction with western societies.

Harvard's Prof Granara acknowledges that donors may have national agendas but says ""universities are pretty clear when they take money that there are no strings attached"". But other academics believe this rule is not always adhered to, particularly where funding goes to Middle East research centres.

""Universities are meant to uphold certain values and objectivity and funding from Gulf countries, especially those notorious for violating human rights, tarnishes the reputation of these centres,"" says Madawi al-Rasheed, a Saudi critic and visiting professor at the LSE's Middle East Centre. ""They [Gulf donors] are creating a sphere of influence at universities ... It's an indirect influence, rather than a direct one.""

One academic says that when he published an article on a Gulf state, a senior member of his UK university emailed him reminding him the subject was ""a donor and longtime partner for the university, 'so please bear that in mind'"". The academic, who asked that neither he nor the institution be identified, later left the university. ""There was no doubt I would have to leave on a moral basis,"" the academic says. ""Would you accept a grant from a Kremlin official and name a building after him? Obviously not.""

A similar debate has been simmering in Australia over concerns about Chinese influence after a series of multimillion-dollar donations to universities by Chinese businessmen with close ties to Beijing, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Chau Chak Wing, chairman of the Kingold Group.

There has been little research into whether foreign funding influences British universities. But the paper by Mr Bergan Draege and Mr Lestra found that before the Arab Spring, Gulf-funded British institutions were less likely to raise issues of democracy and human rights, and ""much less"" issues of gender. Instead, they focused on areas such as youth unemployment and education.

After the 2011 protests, all institutions paid more attention to democracy and human rights, but those funded by Gulf entities ""continued to be somewhat less likely to raise these issues"".

Mr Bergan Draege, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, says that does not imply self-censorship or that the work is more credible at self-funded universities.

""The main difference is more of a focus towards the donor countries, and the output targeting that country focuses less so on certain topics,"" he says. ""It emphasises some of the issues and not other issues [gender rights and democracy]. We don't know if there is a direct causal link, though.""

Filling a funding gap An issue academics repeatedly refer to is dwindling state funding for British universities. The inquiry into the LSE's Libya scandal said British universities have to embark on fundraising on ""the international plane on a scale that until recently was relatively unknown"". It added: ""This scale of global operation carries ethical and reputational risk.""

""The funding climate has changed so drastically over the past 10 to 15 years that they are almost forced to raise money elsewhere. And the Gulf has prioritised through their soft power two things — education and sport,"" says Mr Ulrichsen.

In recent years, numerous western institutions have also established satellite campuses in the UAE and Qatar. US universities Georgetown, Texas A&M and Northwestern, alongside Britain's UCL, are among those with a presence in Doha. New York University and the Sorbonne have campuses in Abu Dhabi.

But not all academics are happy with the situation. After Mr Hedges was sentenced, staff at Birmingham university supported an emergency union motion to boycott a new campus that opened in Dubai this year. The decision was made over concerns about staff safety and the university's failure to ""guarantee academic freedom"" on the campus. The relationships risk being further complicated by a bitter regional rift that pits Saudi Arabia and the UAE against Qatar, with all sides bent on using their soft power to promote their message. The danger for academics is that their research and ties become politicised.

""There is a competition for influence globally between both sides of that dispute and that is fought out across London, Washington and the world, and that makes it difficult for anyone in academia or anyone else to steer a straight path,"" Prof Dodge says. ""What I would do is not pick sides.""

"Crime, legal",Abu Dhabi,"As long as the Emiratis and Saudis shower us with cash, we seem happy to let them violate human rights with impunity

‘Is this any way to treat an ally?” That was the understandable reaction to the life sentence given to Matthew Hedges last month. But the real question, of course, was “is this any way to treat anybody?”

In his

yesterday , the Durham University postgraduate, who was convicted of spying before being “pardoned” and released by the United Arab Emirates, spoke about his mistreatment. He was lucky, he said, that his mother had been at the airport when he was arrested in May because otherwise “no one would have known where I was”. Even so, it was several days before he was allowed a brief phone call to her, six weeks before he was granted a visit by the British embassy, and three months before he was visited by his brave but distraught wife.

By then he had endured daily interrogations lasting up to 15 hours, during which he was often forced to stand shackled. He was kept in solitary confinement in blazing light or, when he complained about that, complete darkness. He was

threatened with being taken to a foreign base where he would be physically tortured. Eventually, he was made to sign a confession written in Arabic, which he did not understand.

He was also told that an old friend, an Emirati, had falsely testified against him. Mr Hedges said he understood why: “In a country like that, that could happen to anyone . . . they could have threatened him with quite a number of options.”

It reminded me of something we’d heard before Mr Hedges’ release. An Emirati academic was interviewed on the BBC. He was sure, he said, that Mr Hedges would have been well treated and any suggestion that he wasn’t would be a lie; that he would have had a fair trial and any suggestion that he hadn’t was a lie; that he must have been a spy and any suggestion that he wasn’t . . . you get the picture. It was a performance so abject yet so brazen that it reminded me of those creatures in the Cold War who went on western media to defend the incarceration of Soviet dissidents in psychiatric hospitals.

The question really should be this: “If this is the way the Emiratis

treat an ally , how the hell do they treat everyone else?” The answer is “shockingly”. In its latest report on the country, Amnesty International draws attention to the arbitrary arrest, detention and mistreatment of anyone the authorities don’t like or suspect of misbehaviour. People have been imprisoned for posting on Facebook. They have been held incommunicado, in solitary confinement and some may have been tortured. Unfortunately for them, they don’t come from places the UAE needs to impress.

As for us, we are fabulous business associates of the Emirati ruling classes. When Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, UAE’s minister of foreign affairs, visited Britain in September, it was announced that trade between us had risen by 12 per cent, to £17.5 billion. Matthew Hedges was, at the time, in a cell in Abu Dhabi.

We have lauded the opening of the

Abu Dhabi Louvre , profited from the Abu Dhabi royal family becoming the largest landowner in Mayfair, sold the Emiratis our hotels, New Scotland Yard, 16 per cent of Gatwick airport, 10 per cent of Thames Water and the Excel conference centre in London. Fans of Premier League champions Manchester City have thrilled to the success of their team, purchased by the Abu Dhabi royals who have poured hundreds of millions into the club — possibly in breach of football’s “financial fair play” rules. Don’t expect a fuss about that from fans. Their trophy cabinets are becoming stuffed with silver. As may be ours.

Mr Hedges’ wife, Daniela Tejada, believes that the Foreign Office was reluctant to make representations on her husband’s behalf, partly because of Britain’s economic interests. You can see why she thinks it.

It’s a similar story in the United States, where the Republican senator Lindsey Graham said this week: “You have to be wilfully blind not to come to the conclusion . . . that Mohammed bin Salman [crown prince of Saudi Arabia] was intrinsically involved in the demise of [Jamal] Khashoggi.”

He had every right to sound exasperated. A couple of weeks earlier, President Trump had also spoken about the murder of the

Washington Post columnist and critic of Saudi Arabia. “I hate the crime,” he said, “I hate the cover-up. I will tell you this: the crown prince hates it more than I do, and they have vehemently denied it.” The crown prince hates it? The crown prince is responsible for it! But then Mr Trump was asked who should be held accountable for Khashoggi’s murder. “Maybe the world should be held accountable,” he replied, “because the world is a very, very vicious place.” Which means, of course, that no one should be held accountable. The high-five with which President Putin greeted the crown prince at the G20 last week was a welcome into the

freemasonry of impunity . “They may complain,” it said, “but they’ll still want your money and my gas.”

Some of our reticence about the Gulf states is about money, some about strategy and some about “the world is a vicious, vicious place” fatalism. But in fact we do have tools to punish offenders. The American Magnitsky Act, named after a Russian anti-corruption lawyer who died in a Moscow prison, targets individuals responsible for human rights abuses, bans them from entry to the US, freezes their assets around the world and generally harasses them. Passing such an act here and then applying it to, say, the UAE minister of the interior and his cronies might have a salutary effect.

What are the human rights of others worth to us when all’s said and done? Labour’s Baroness Chakrabarti claimed yesterday that her party would get a better deal on Brexit than the Tories, partly because Labour was hotter on human rights. Seriously? A few days earlier, Lara McNeill, a member of the party’s national executive committee, said: “I hope to visit Cuba and see socialism in action!” Cuban artists have recently been detained by the authorities for protesting against a law that gives the ministry of culture a veto over any display or performance. Is that, in the Corbyn era, “socialism in action”?

In his interview, Mr Hedges asked if the government “is putting trade, is putting finance, is putting anything else over the values it stands for?” Some readers will reply “yes, and a good thing too”. They’ll happily suck the golden gobstopper or don the rose-tinted glasses.

After all, if you don’t make a fuss and don’t go where you shouldn’t, none of this will happen to you. Until the day it does.

"Crime, legal",Dubai,"Sri Lanka, Feb. 11 -- The Dubai Police yesterday had arrested drug smuggler Angoda Lokka, an associate of Makandure Madush who fled the scene when Dubai Police arrested Madush and another 16 suspects last Tuesday.

He has been arrested by the police when he was hiding at another hotel in Dubai, Police Special Task Force (STF) said. The blood samples had revealed Angoda Lokka was under the influence of Hashish.

Meanwhile, Makandure Madush and other suspects who were arrested earlier were produced before the Dubai Courts yesterday morning.

According to senior STF officials, it would take some time for the judges to declare the verdict on them as the Dubai Police have to present inquiry reports separately on the 16 suspects.

Sri Lankan authorities have already sent a report including all measures taken by the Defence Ministry and the Courts and the international red notices issued to arrest these smugglers to the Dubai Police. This report was also presented before the Dubai Courts by the Dubai Police. It has also been requested through this report to hand over these smugglers to the Sri Lankan authorities.

The Sri Lanka Police and the STF are conducting investigations to nab the close associates of the arrested drug kingpins. During the past three days, the Police and the STF had arrested about 20 suspects in connection with the crimes such as drug smuggling and organised crimes. Notorious drug dealer Andarawatte Chamara, who was arrested yesterday at Mattakkuliya is also among them.

Shanaka Madhushan alias Olu Mara and 11 others were also arrested at Wennappuwa yesterday and another group of suspects were arrested from the Southern Province as well. Some of them were close associates of Makandure Madush.

"Crime, legal",Dubai,"New Delhi, Feb. 11 -- The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has tracked a dozen Swiss bank accounts in the name of Rajiv Saxena, who is key accused in the Rs 3,600 crore AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam. The ED has also found out accounts held by his family members and associates where the kickbacks in the now scrapped deal were allegedly parked.

Two bank accounts are in the name of Rajiv Saxena's associates Pankaj Jain and Sumita Jain who are also the authorised signatories. The third is in the name of another associate Ajit Singh Bubber, but Rajiv and his family members are authorised signatories. The remaining nine accounts are largely owned and operated by Rajiv, his family members and associates.

Rajiv Saxena was deported by the UAE authorities on January 30 and the ED formally arrested him the next day and a court later granted his remand to the agency. He is currently undergoing custodial interrogation by the ED. The agency had in 2017 arrested his wife Shivani who is now enlarged in bail.

The ED probe has revealed that AgustaWestland International Ltd, UK paid an amount of Euro 58 million as kickbacks through Gordian Services Sarl, Tunisia and IDS Sarl, Tunisia. These companies further siphoned off the kickback money/ Proceeds of Crime in the name of consultancy contracts to Interstellar Technologies Ltd., Mauritius and others, which were further transferred to UHY Saxena, Dubai, Matrix Holdings Ltd. Dubai and others.

The probe also revealed that Rajiv Saxena is owner of Interstellar Technologies Ltd., Mauritius. Rajiv Saxena and his wife Shivani are partners/ Directors in UHY Saxena, Dubai and Matrix Holdings Limited, Dubai. Both these companies received proceeds of bribe in their respective Dubai bank accounts from Interstellar Technologies Ltd. Mauritius.

Investigation by ED also revealed that Rajiv Saxena and his wife Shivani have remitted/ transferred huge amount of money through their companies at Dubai to various other accounts including in the Swiss Bank accounts, sources said.

The ED is probing why Rajiv Saxena is maintaining a dozen Swiss bank accounts if he and his family members were the only beneficial owners, the sources further said.

"Crime, legal",Dubai,"NNA - Prime Minister Saad Hariri highlighted the government's intention to fight corruption, a statement by Hariri's Press Office indicated on Sunday.

""The President of the Council of Ministers Saad Hariri highlighted the government's intention to fight corruption, adding that the most important challenges facing the government will be squander and corruption,"" the statement indicated, noting that Hariri was replying to questions from a number of television stations in the UAE.

Question: Do you think there are external interventions to obstruct reforms in Lebanon?

Hariri: Foreign interventions have nothing to do with reforms. Our problem, as Lebanese, is that we use interventions as a pretext to block issues. What we agreed on as Lebanese political parties is that the regional disputes will continue. I will not be convinced of Hezbollah’s policy nor will Hezbollah be convinced of mine. So what should we do about that? Shall we block the country or put the regional differences aside and carry out reforms that benefit the Lebanese citizen?

In the past, there was a revival but no one reflected on its positive or negative points. When globalization happened, a large part of the world did not benefit from it. Today, the debate is about how to face this and other challenges.

Question: Is it possible to transfer the Emirati experience to Lebanon? Are there assurances for expatriates about Lebanon’s future?

Hariri: We should not only transfer this experience but we should also learn. The most important thing is to benefit each other. There are things we can learn from the UAE and vice versa. The government that will carry out this work is a government that enjoys a national consensus in Lebanon. Therefore, we must carry out the reforms. All my focus now is on implementing these reforms for the interest of the Lebanese economy, the investor, the Lebanese citizen, and the Lebanese youth.

Question: What are the most important challenges that will face the government?

Hariri: Fighting corruption and squander is one of the most important things we will face. Corruption is rampant in Lebanon and this is a fact we must face.

"Crime, legal",Dubai,"KAMPALA - The Uganda Police Force have confirmed that they are ready to investigate circumstances under which a Ugandan woman was found in possession of drugs at Dubai airport.

Police Spokesperson Fred Enanga told New Vision, that over the weekend, they got information about luggage that had been intercepted by Dubai authorities from a Ugandan woman only identified as Shaniz Kartel.

Of course we have to respect the laws of Dubai where she was arrested. Well, she may be a victim of circumstance but we may not rule out the issue of negligence on her side. We want to establish the person whom Vegas sent to bring the consignment to Shaniz before she left Entebbe airport and how this happened without our security discovering there were drugs inside.” Enanga said.

Police says, Shaniz case should be an eye-opener to all Ugandans who go to the airport that it is very risky to help carry anyone's luggage whose content you are not aware of.

Through our Anti-narcotic department, we shall go back into the system and check to ascertain who gave in the luggage, who checked it, when and how it left the airport without noticing there was some drugs inside.” Enanga added.

According to an audio said to be recorded by Shaniz, it is alleged that as she was going back to Dubai from Uganda, one Samson Kyamaggwa alias ‘DJ Vegas' asked her to bring him some Matooke not knowing that inside the luggage, they had placed some drugs.

Upon reaching the Dubai airport, authorities intercepted the luggage and apprehended her as well.

Shaniz is one of the self-styled city socialites with a record of spending money whenever she jets into the country.

It is alleged that a few years ago, she scooped a deal and won some good money in a jackpot in Bangkok, Thailand, before she relocated to Dubai.

Preliminary investigations show that Kyamaggwa was residing in Turkey before he relocated to Dubai, where he recently got a job at Rock-pool.

It should be recalled that in 2013, female artiste Irene Namubiru, was also arrested and detained at Cheba Prefecture Police Station in Japan for allegedly being in possession of MDGF, a narcotic drug made from cocaine worth Sh1.9b.

The drugs were allegedly placed inside a luggage which her male friend one, Hakim Tumwesigye, asked her to carry for him.

Luckily, Police did not find any evidence linking her to the crime and later cleared her. SK Mbuga is also among the list of other Ugandans who have fallen prey to such drug scandals.

"Crime, legal",Dubai,"(Alamy) A man, who misled the authorities here after he falsely claimed that his son is dead, has been charged at the Dubai Court of First Instance.

Prosecutors are seeking a stiff penalty against the 34-year-old Syrian businessman after their probe findings showed that he had forged a certificate stating that his son passed away, and made it an official document by having it attested at the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Syrian Embassy here.

Hetampered with the papers to avoid fulfilling his obligations as a father and pay alimony to his wife, as decided by a Dubai Sharia Court order.

The man denied charges of forgery, use of forged document, and misleading the judicial system. The case was exposed on July 16, last year and was registered at Al Rashidiya police station.

An Egyptian PRO, 30, said that the defendant filed an objection about an execution procedure before the Dubai Personal Status Court, to which he enclosed his son's 'death certificate' on July 16, last year.

""The court then ruled that his son's custody case be dismissed. After the ruling was appealed, another court ruled in favour of the defendant's wife who presented her family's registration papers to the Court of Appeals.""

The PRO added that an investigation was then launched after it became clear that the accused presented a fake death certificate of his son to avoid paying the alimony allocated by the Shariah Court to his wife.

The PRO told the public prosecution investigator that the defendant had typed and printed a death certificate, which he attributed to the civil affairs department of the Ministry of Interior of the Syrian Republic in their offices in Lebanon.

The Dubai Police crime lab examined the certificate and concluded it is fake.

According to prosecution records, the businessman falsified the paper and attributed it to the Beirut office of the Syrian departments concerned.

The businessman will be sentenced on February 27.

The Court of First Instance heard how the 29-year-old Pakistani man, a project supervisor, reassured the victim, a Filipina, that he would not hurt her, which made her confident to let him take her in his car.

According to public prosecution records, the incident took place on November 14, last year, when the defendant invited the victim to dinner and would not take her back home but insisted she went to a caf with him. However, he drove to a desert location where he raped her twice inside his car. A case was registered at Jebel Ali police station.

Prosecutors accused the man, who is detained, of kidnap, rape and sexual assault.

He denied the charges, claiming it was consensual sex.

During prosecution investigation, the victim, a 25-year-old Filipina accountant, recounted how she had met the defendant about one month prior to the incident. ""We used to chat on WhatsApp. On the day of the incident, I sent him a message, after which he invited me out, promising not to hurt me.""

The man picked her up in his workplace pickup vehicle around 8:30pm and took her to dinner at a restaurant and then to another caf. ""However, after that he drove speedily and would not tell me about his destination. He parked somewhere off-road under trees,"" she said.

He stepped off the car, went to her seat and then pulled her to the back of the car where he sexually assaulted the victim while she kicked him. He punched and bit her to stop her from resisting him and then raped her again.

As she was putting onher clothes, he forced her to kiss him while he was filming her.

Before dropping the woman to her place, he bought some bandages and food. He threatened to kill her if she reported him to the police. ""He said he had influential connections and that I should answer his messages and calls,"" she recounted.

The victim confided to her friend and they lodged a police complaint.

She described the crime scene as unlit and in the middle of nowhere. ""I could not run away as it was very far from my place and I didn't know where we were. I did not take any money or any stuff from the defendant,"" she told the investigator.

She said the assault left her with bruises and injuries.

A police officer said they arrested the defendant shortly after receiving the complaint.

""The man claimed it was consensual. He said he had pictures of her kissing him. However, the victim said that he took those videos and photos against her will so to make it took like she was a consenting partner.""

The defendant's DNA traces were found on the victim's under garments, as per a forensic report.

The investigators said that the emotional way, in which the victim was recalling the incident, is an indication that it was a forcible assault.

The next hearing has been scheduled for February 19.

Labor issues,Abu Dhabi,"The UAE continued to generate new jobs during most of 2018 with Dubai emerging the brightest spot in the country's employment market.

According to data from the Central Bank of the UAE, employment eased in the third quarter, growing moderately by 0.6 per cent compared to an increase of 1.2 per cent in the second quarter. Accordingly, employment rose by 1.6 per cent during the first three quarters on average, compared to a 2.6 per cent increase during the same period in 2017.

Quoting data from the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation, the central bank report said that total employment in the UAE was 5.025 million, of which 51.3 per cent are based in Dubai, 27.5 per cent in Abu Dhabi and 21.2 per cent in the Northern Emirates.

Dubai was the main driver for growth in the labour market during 2017 and in the first three quarters of 2018, with an average quarterly growth rate of 0.8 per cent. The emirate created 45,900 new jobs in the first three quarters with a growth rate of 1.8 per cent compared to the end of 2017. However, employment growth rates in the emirate started to pick up in the third quarter of 2018, reaching a quarter-on-quarter growth around 0.7 per cent compared to 0.03 per cent in the previous three-month period.

Abu Dhabi, meanwhile, had an average drop in employment growth during the first three quarters of 2018 by 3.3 per cent compared to a 0.7 per cent growth during the same period in 2017.

Similarly, in the Northern Emirates, employment decreased by 0.46 per cent in the third quarter on a quarter-to-quarter basis, compared to a decline of 0.86 per cent in the second.

Suhail Masri, vice-president of employer solutions at Bayt.com, said Dubai and Abu Dhabi emerge as the top cities in terms of job availability in the Mena region. The two emirates are also the top cities in terms of benefits for working parents.

""Dubai and Abu Dhabi are all rated highest on ability to find skilled and well-educated talent to employ,"" he added.

Pankaj Mundra, co-founder of Nimai Group, said all seven emirates have taken various initiatives in the last few years to promote employment but Dubai remains the favourite destination for expats, as well as new investors and employers.

Sectors' performance

According to the central bank data, employment in the construction sector, which accounts for around 30 per cent of the total workforce in the UAE, moderated at a downward pace as it increased jobs by 1 per cent. Real estate and other sectors reached 4.4 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.

The construction and real estate sectors together absorb around 46 per cent of the labour force in the UAE. Employment in both sectors eased to 1.9 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2018, against a 2.8 per cent increase in the previous quarter.

Slower employment growth was mainly driven by the services sector - employing more than 20 per cent of the total - which decreased by 1.3 per cent in the third quarter, followed by manufacturing and transport, and storage and communication sectors, which declined by 1.1 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively.

Accordingly, employment growth rates in the UAE remained virtually stable with a quarter-on-quarter decline of 0.05 per cent in the third quarter, similar to the previous three-month period.

On a sectoral level, the construction, services and real estate sectors account for 67.9 per cent of total employment. The growth rates of employment in the construction and services sectors declined 0.1 per cent and 0.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter, respectively, while real estate witnessed an increase of 0.68 per cent in the third quarter.

Abhijeet Mukherjee, CEO of Monster for the Asia-Pacific, said technology-related occupations in the UAE have witnessed the most growth in 2018 at 25 per cent during the first three quarters of the year.

""The recent increase in hiring activity within the sector is no surprise given the UAE's rapid digital transformation, as well as the recent announcements of smart city mega projects like Sharjah's $6.5 billion Aljada Smart City. As Expo 2020 Dubai approaches, we are also seeing an influx of occupations related to advertising and marketing as Dubai continues to promote and position itself as an attractive global destination for tourism and FDI,"" said Mukherjee.

Masri said that based on employers' responses to the Middle East Job Index Survey, the real estate and construction sector (34 per cent) emerges as the industry that attracts top talent across the UAE, followed by advertising, marketing and public relations (32 per cent), banking and finance (30 per cent), engineering (26 per cent), IT (24 per cent), business consultancy (23 per cent) and telecom (21 per cent).

Mundra noted that contracting companies have employed and will employ as they get ready to deliver projects for Expo 2020.

""Hospitality and tourism sectors continue to grow as Dubai and others emirates keep building new landmarks to attract tourists. The Dubai Frame, the Louvre Abu Dhabi and Noor Island in Sharjah are the new landmarks that have attracted tourists to stay one or two extra [days]. Ten years back a tourist will stay for four days in Dubai, which have just doubled to eight days, creating new job opportunities,"" he said.

In addition, there are also new opportunities for finance professionals due to the implementation of value-added tax. Senior finance professionals in Dubai will see opportunities in tax audit in 2019.

Labor issues,Abu Dhabi,"A 43-year-old Filipina expat, who was stuck in the UAE for almost eight years, being jobless and facing a travel ban over a Dh190,000 bounced cheque conviction, is among the many workers who have been helped by the human rights authorities in Abu Dhabi to start new lives.

Fatma Abdulrahim Obaid, head of the Human Rights Section at the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department (ADJD) told Khaleej Times on the sidelines of the Labour Court Information Forum on Monday that her office had handled and solved 23 cases of workers with various problems during the first six months of 2018. The human rights office had handled 42 cases during 2017.

Most of the cases, according to Fatma, involve workers facing immigration issues such as absconding, work ban from employers and other legal issues.

And among the recent cases they received was that of a Filipina who was apparently staying illegally in the country after her visa had expired for many years. The woman had become jobless after spending time in jail over a bounced cheque and was also facing a travel ban because she couldn't pay Dh190,000 on the dud cheque as she didn't have any source of income.

""The poor woman had spent time moving from office to office, seeking help, but couldn't find hope until she was directed to the human rights section,"" said Obaid.

""She came to us crying. She had spent almost eight years stuck in the country and without a job. She couldn't move out of the country because she had a travel ban on her as she was unable to pay the amount on the bounced cheque,"" she said.

She said in just a day after receiving her case, the human rights office helped the woman have her arrest warrant removed temporarily and her name was cleared with the immigration office so that she could get a visa and find a new job enabling her to repay the money.

""We have helped her get the six-month jobseekers temporary residence visa under the ongoing amnesty scheme and she is now living happily and freely in the country as she looks for a job,"" said Obaid.

She said her office is helping many people with different cases, including getting them lawyers to ensure that their human rights are considered and also to give them hope.

Judicial Department keen on ensuring workers get their rights

Chief Justice Abdullah Faris Ali Al Nuami, head of the Abu Dhabi Labour Court, said that the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department is keen on protecting the rights of workers and it has undertaken many initiatives in this regard. These include organising workshops and field visits to workers' accommodations to teach workers about the labour law and their rights, human trafficking and other related issues so that they can file complaints to authorities in case their rights are violated.

""The department introduced a mobile court to handle cases involving disputes between workers living in one area and their employers and last year, a One-day Labour Court was established in Abu Dhabi to cut waiting time and ensure quick verdicts in cases that do not exceed Dh20,000. The court has so far handled 700 cases,"" he said.

He noted that the judicial department also launched on its website a system that can help or show workers how to calculate their end of service gratuity. It has also established a legal aid office to help workers facing problems or have disputes with their employers.

Benjimin Burger, legal consultant at the ADJD, said the department will soon introduce a Happiness Card - a charitable support card for vulnerable workers, to assist them in the travel and substance expenses, while the labour case is ongoing and is being considered.

""We have also arranged with the Emirates Red Crescent to provide financial assistance to individuals in need,"" he said.

According to official figures, the number of complaints and labour cases handled by the Abu Dhabi Public Prosecution has dropped from 16,897 cases in 2017 to 9,979 cases in 2018.

Most of the complaints involve workers for non-payment of wages by their employers.

They further forge partnerships and cooperation between federal and local government entities, with integrated initiatives and united efforts, which has become a constant approach in government work thanks to the wise leadership of the UAE, their continuous follow-up and guidance.

He added that these meetings constitute a national platform that witnesses the participation of the UAE wise leadership and its prominent leaders working in various government entities. This ensures that the innovative plans and initiatives will lead the way to achieving the UAE vision on the short, medium and long terms through developing human capital capabilities.

The initiatives include the Citizen Redistribution Policy between Public and Private Sectors, which is a job rotation mechanism working between the two sectors. It aims to delegate experienced and competent staff from the public sector to work in leading positions in the private sector with the aim of expanding their careers prospects, encouraging UAE citizens to seek jobs in the private sector, and providing them with additional skills. This approach aims at achieving the Emiratisation goals stipulated by the development plans and enhance self-confidence among Emiratis by gaining experience from working in the private sector.

The team also launched an initiative to establish a Unified e-Portal for Self-Employment of Skilled Personnel to support the Emiratisation efforts. The portal connects talented national skills with different programs and services, and coordinates with public and private sector companies to leverage their expertise and enhance their skills. Moreover, it includes a bundle of facilities and incentives for companies that use the portal to hire national competencies.

The government further adopted the Continuous Skills Development System, an integrated system that includes federal and local governmental entities. It develops continuous education programmes to boost the skills of employees and workers in the labour market and align their skills with the future demands of the labour market.

It also guarantees continuous and proactive education for the work force, to keep pace with the technological developments and future trends, which would ultimately impact jobs in the labour market. This would further contribute to enhancing the work force skills and improving its productivity by gaining the necessary new skills.

Achieving balance among the labour market sectors is one of the goals that the UAE government seeks to achieve by increasing Emiratisation in the private sector, promoting women’s participation in a way that serves the UAE economy and its competitiveness indicators, as well as gender balance. It also endeavors to boost UAE citizens’ knowledge and skills to prepare them to work in various sectors, as well as encourage the private sector to create suitable opportunities for them. This goes in line with the significant progress achieved by the UAE in keeping pace with the numerous developments in the labor market.

Notably, the UAE Government seeks to achieve the National Agenda goals, namely increasing Emiratisation in the private sector and enhancing the participation of national cadres in the analytical and service jobs. It further aims at promoting entrepreneurship and developing viable solutions for the challenges that the UAE economy might face by 2031, and ultimately achieve the UAE Vision 2071.

With slower economic growth and job losses becoming a common phenomenon across the globe, the process of nationalisation and Emiratisation took the spotlight at the sixth GOV HR Summit held in Abu Dhabi.

Based on the surveys and findings of various agencies, an expert pointed out that the non-nationals in the GCC workforce is estimated at 75 per cent, and the UAE had the largest number of expats in workforce at 91 per cent. In 2018, nationals formed just eight per cent of the UAE workforce. The number is projected to further dip to six per cent in 2020 and to 3 per cent by 2030.

Dr Jasim Al Ali, deputy CEO for shared services, Dubai Media Incorporated, said 2030 is going to be a 'catastrophic' year.

""It's high time that nationalisation policy gets the attention. The GCC countries and private sector companies have made this a top priority. However, the obstacles related to organisational inefficiencies, failure of leadership, and management style in both the public and private sector have resulted in the ineffectivity of the nationalisation policy. We are talking about nationalisation for the last three decades but so far we have failed to increase the number of nationals in the public and private sector,"" he said.

He noted the need for a sustainable policy to find right national talents for the right jobs.

Ali said that according to government statistics, the employment of nationals remains at less than 2 per cent in the private sector, which comprises more than 62 per cent of the total jobs in the country.

Also, jobseekers have increased from 30,000 in 2006 to 36,000 in 2018.

""Jobseekers in the GCC stand at an average of 6.1 per cent. Oman and Bahrain at 15 per cent, Saudi Arabia at 11.8 per cent, the UAE at 4.2 per cent, Kuwait at 4.1 per cent and the lowest in Qatar at 1.5 per cent,"" he said.

Ali said the total population of the GCC has reached over 54 million in 2018 and is expected to grow by nearly 12 million in 2030. GCC states need to create 500,000 top private jobs annually at twice the present salaries.

'Nationalisation is no number game'

Meanwhile, Faisal Shanfari, general manager for shared services at Oman Oil Marketing Company, said nationalisation needs to be addressed soon as the issue is starting to grow bigger. ""There is an issue in Oman with unemployment of nationals.""

He said there are unique programmes in the GCC addressing the different segments of nationalisation. ""One programme is on preparing the workforce as per needs of the market. Another is on enhancing the skills as per requirement.""

He highlighted the need to shift the nationalisation strategy from a numbers game to a quality game. ""Companies can't hire nationals just to achieve the numbers, because later on, it will affect productivity and lead to catastrophic scenarios.""

He said that in Oman, the government has teamed up with big companies to identify the talent pool and to nurture them. ""This process may be slow but will get the market the remedy needed for a national workforce.""

Shanfari said foreign workers in the country needn't be apprehensive about the strategy of nationalisation. ""National workforce is not to replace the expatriates. Developing countries in the GCC need lot of manpower, including nationals and expats,"" he added

He added that the index is the result of the government’s comprehensive overall efforts on local and federal levels while stressing that everyone will benefit from its outcomes.

Al Khaili further added that both sides aim, through analysing the survey’s outcomes, to make the UAE’s citizens and residents happy and help accelerate community development.

He also pointed out that the criteria used in many international indexes were used in the survey to track social wellbeing.

Al Khaili highlighted the importance of the partnerships between ministries and government authorities and the public and private sectors while noting the effective role of the private sector and its key presence in specialised projects in all sectors.

The department is working, through the ""Community Development Agenda"" of Abu Dhabi, to support social harmony and cooperate with its partners from the public and private sectors, Al Khaili affirmed while highlighting the fact that Abu Dhabi provides an ideal life and happiness, through supporting its community's ability to achieve sustainable development.

Labor issues,Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, 30th July, 2018 (WAM) -- The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation has paved the way for school pupils, aged 15 and above, to obtain paid part-time employment during holidays, said The National on Monday.

In its editorial, the paper added, ""This is one of many initiatives that seek to propel young Emiratis into the private sector by giving them direct experience of the rewards on offer.""""In the UAE, the public sector has historically been seen as the more prestigious and rewarding career path. After all, it is the country's leadership, as embodied by the Founding Father, Sheikh Zayed, which has led the way in terms of innovation, ambition and creativity, finding great success in the process. So it is hardly surprising that the government would be the most alluring potential employer for new job seekers.

""However, times change. More and more today, the UAE's success is based on responding to an evolving world. In the future, the country wants to be considered among the top 10 nations on earth; in order to get there, certain realities must be accepted. The fact that youth unemployment and underemployment in the Middle East is among the highest in the world makes the issue all the more pressing,"" it continued.

The English language daily went on to say that the UAE has a young population. ""Creating enough jobs to provide for this talented and forward thinking generation is a critical part of the country's ambitions. This, it could be argued, means that taking opportunities to work in the private sector is now as critical a part of nation building as serving the government has been for the past 47 years.

""The private sector also offers many benefits. A more efficient form of meritocracy – in which the cream rises to the top faster – is one of them. It can also provide a more intensive environment for developing skills, emotional intelligence and a better understanding of the world, given the diversity – of colleagues, assignments and international markets – it offers."":However, to truly understand what is on offer, one must experience it. Part-time jobs and internships have always been the best way to give youngsters an insight into daily working life. Paving the way for more school-age pupils to acquire this experience will help them discover a world of rewarding opportunities once their education is complete,"" the Abu Dhabi-based daily concluded.

Labor issues,Abu Dhabi,"Manila, Jul 26 (EFE).- Nearly 1,000 Filipino migrant workers have been repatriated this year after facing labor abuse and exploitation in the United Arab Emirates, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday.

Since January, 969 Philippine citizens have returned to their native country, out of 777 who had sought refuge in the Philippine embassy in Abu Dhabi and its consulate in Dubai.

""I condemn strongly the abuses being experienced by our OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) in the hands of their recruiters or employers,"" Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said in a statement.

According to DFA data, there are 643,000 registered Filipino workers in the UAE, most of them in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, although the real number could be much higher if thousands of undocumented workers are taken into account.

Philippine women mostly find work as domestic help in the UAE, while the majority of the men are employed in the construction sector, often in dangerous conditions and without employment guarantees.

""When these abuses happen, the DFA can be expected to act decisively to protect our (citizens) and bring them home,"" Cayetano said.

In his annual State of the Nation address on Monday, President Rodrigo Duterte had insisted that the well-being of Philippine citizens abroad was the main foreign policy thrust of his government,

The controversy over abuse and exploitation of Filipino workers abroad escalated in February when the corpse of Joanna Demafelis, a 29-year old Philippine woman, was found in the freezer of her employers' house in Kuwait, after she had been missing for a year.

The incident led to Duterte banning Filipino workers from going to Kuwait, which later expelled the Philippine ambassador, although the two countries normalized ties in May and the ban was lifted.

On Thursday, the Philippines announced that it would launch an online program to tackle abuse and check fake offers and the 3,000 workers who leave the country daily to work abroad would be able to assess the contract offered by the employment agency.

Around 10 million Filipinos are employed abroad, and their remittances are vital for the Philippine economy.

Labor issues,Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, 7th July, 2018 (WAM) -- Sandooq Al Watan today announced the start of the second phase of the Emirati Coder programme.

The programme was developed in conjunction with Abu Dhabi-based education consultancy Ajyal Talent Management, a DarkMatter company.

Labor issues,Dubai,"Online demand for occupations within the technology space has been registering continuous growth year-on-year.

(File photo)

As we approach the end of another year, now is an opportune time to reflect, evaluate and begin planning for the future.

2018 at a glance

For businesses, large or small, public or private, 2018 can be described as a period of recovery and resilience.

Our recently-published Monster whitepaper for 2018 has shown that online hiring across the UAE has improved dramatically over the last nine months, reaching an all-time high of 28 per cent in the third quarter of 2018. As the economy continues to find its footing after a turbulent 2017, the ongoing recovery of the UAE's job market is attributed to stabiliSing oil prices and the fiscal reform initiatives announced by the country's leadership.

Road ahead positive

In September 2018, the International Monetary Fund raised the economic forecasts of all GCC countries for 2019. According to its World Economic Outlook report, the UAE is projected to grow by almost 4 per cent in 2019.

The private sector can be a key stakeholder in the economic and urban development of the UAE in the coming 12 months. In addition to driving national income and helping reduce the nation's dependency on oil, the introduction of long-term visas for professionals and easier licensing requirements for new businesses will create jobs. This is a welcome and much needed boost for the private sector in the UAE, which was once viewed as 'secondary' in an oil-dependent nation like the Emirates.

During the same period last year, Ghadan 21 was announced by His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The plan, which translates into 'Tomorrow 21', is a Dh50 billion stimulus package that is designed to develop the private sector in the UAE over the next three years.

Perhaps most importantly, almost half of the Dh50 billion allocation is expected to be spent in 2019 towards the development of non-oil sectors like technology. The investment injection in technology is logical - almost necessary - given the long-term benefits it provides to a developing economy.

UAE job market to be tech-driven

The adoption of an innovation-led and technology driven economy is at the top of the UAE's priorities in 2019. In early 2018, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, pledged to accelerate the progress made on the objectives of Vision 2021, the country's national agenda.

Falling under the umbrella of Vision 2021 is the highly-ambitious Dubai Smart initiative. Tasked with transforming the future of Dubai through smart technology and innovation, the initiative has fueled hiring in the technology sector. Our latest data has shown that the demand for technology professionals increased by 25 per cent during the first three quarters of 2018. In fact, online demand for occupations within the space has been registering double-digit year-on-year growth since September 2017, which is truly remarkable.

The upward trajectory of the technology sector over the last few years in the UAE has been fascinating. To witness the nation, go through such a rapid transformation, across all levels of government and society, is a testament to the ambition and determination of the country's leadership. We are not seeing any signs of dwindling momentum which is even more remarkable. In fact, Dr Aisha bin Butti bin Bishr, director-general of Smart Dubai, recently affirmed that the UAE would begin implementing major technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain across most government bodies at the start of 2019.

In a bid to work towards harnessing technology locally, the Abu Dhabi government recently formed a partnership with the private sector to create and launch a new technology incubator to attract and develop startups. This is indicative of the forward-thinking nature of the country's leadership and will drive entrepreneurship, resulting in an influx of new entrepreneurial talent within the sector.

Conclusion

Despite strong headwinds in 2017, the UAE economy and job market were resilient, and both have rebounded strongly since. Largely driven by stabilising oil prices and the swift action by the UAE government, 2019 is full of optimism and innovation. I am confident that technology will be the key to unlocking the UAE's monumental potential. Let us see if this rings true in the coming year - I have a strong predisposition that it will.

Labor issues,Dubai,"Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development , Zulfikar Bukhari visited Khan Saheb Labor Camp, Jabal Ali in Dubai to interact with the Pakistani workforce. The visit was first of its kind as no minister had ever visited a labor camp to review working conditions of Pakistani workforce there, said a news release received here from UAE. Zulfikar Bukhari interacted with the workers and reviewed their accommodation, dining and prayers facilities to get an overall picture of the provisions being offered to the laborers by their employers. Addressing the workers, he said ""You will soon feel a sense of ownership.

The government is standing behind you and you have to stand up for your country and serve it in whatever capacity you can"". Zulfikar Bukhari emphasized the need to use legal channels for sending money to their country instead of ""Hundi System"". He said Pakistan needed special attention of the Pakistanis working abroad. At this time, sending money through banking channels would be seen as a service to the country, he said. Zulfikar Bukhari also stated that taking care of the workers was the responsibility of the Overseas Ministry and assured that the government vowed not to isolate their workforce working far away from their homes. He said aim of the visit was to understand the problems of Pakistanis working in Gulf countries.

Labor issues,Dubai,"DUBAI, 27th January, 2019 (WAM) -- Dubai Cares, part of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives, has announced a new strategic partnership with the World Economic Forum (WEF) during its annual meeting in Davos, to support the reskilling revolution, in a bid to provide skills to 15 million people by 2021.

Dubai Cares’ US$1.5 million in funding will be equally allocated to two critical three-year programmes managed by WEF’s Centre for the New Economy and Society, CNES. The CNES vision is to build dynamic and inclusive economies and societies that provide a future of opportunities for all. One of the programmes focuses on identifying future skills and preparing the education and training systems accordingly, while the other focuses on codifying these future skills in order to transition from the current degree-based into a skill-based labour market.

The first programme, ‘Closing the Skills Gap: Preparing Education Systems for the Future of Work’, aims to build a network of public-private partnerships in 10 countries, initially, to be increased to 15 national economies by 2020, over half of which will be in developing countries. It is set to focus on the demand for future skills and prepare education and training systems to meet the demands of today’s job market. As part of this, the programme seeks to invite participating companies to make public, measureable commitments to train and reskill the current and future workforce.

The second programme, ‘Shared Vision for Talent in the Fourth Industrial Revolution’, aims to address the growing mismatch between the supply and demand of future skills in the labour market. The programme seeks to make this model operational by working with key business players, top universities and the EdTech community.

The Dubai Cares delegation, led by Tariq Al Gurg, Chief Executive Officer, attended various high-level events and meetings during the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, which included the Co-Impact luncheon on collaborative philanthropy, hosted by Bill Gates, the UNICEF meeting on the role of young people in the fourth industrial revolution, a high-level roundtable discussion on refugee education organised by Save the Children and Community Jameel, as well as the Varkey Foundation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) receptions. The delegation also had a number of bilateral meetings with both corporate and philanthropic partners.

Labor issues,Dubai,"DUBAI, 5th January 2019 (WAM) - The National Programme for Happiness and Wellbeing has launched 120 practical models to enhance wellbeing in the workplace at both public and private sector entities.

The initiative supports government and private entities’ efforts to promote wellbeing concepts and practices in the workplace, and facilitates the implementation of the National Agenda for Wellbeing.

The models aim to develop a work culture based on four pillars: enhancing health, strengthening relations, achieving capacities, and establishing purpose.

The models are an initiative of the National Program for Happiness and Wellbeing, to help human resources departments to improve working, injecting new ideas into their existing programmes and initiatives to promote wellbeing concepts and practices into the work environment and employ them to boost productivity and performance.

The National Program for Happiness and Wellbeing will be conducting training programmes and workshops for government and private entities to raise awareness of workplace wellbeing and help implement it across all sectors.

Ohoud bint Khalfan Al Roumi, Minister of State for Happiness and Wellbeing, Director General of the Prime Minister’s Office, asserted that the workplace wellbeing models are developed by the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, that employees are the government’s most valuable asset.

The main mission of the National Program for Happiness and Wellbeing is to develop practical applications of H.H.’s directives, as well as the tools to implement them, Al Roumi noted.

""Enhancing workplace wellbeing reflects positively on the work environment and boosts performance and productivity"", she explained, adding that it supports the efforts of government and private entities to establish a work environment that prioritises its human capital.

The workplace wellbeing models focus on human resources to develop human capital at each entity, focusing on the role of positive leadership in motivating employees, and providing a set of scientific instruments and applications that drive workplace wellbeing.

The models cover four main pillars: enhancing health, strengthening relations, achieving capacities, and establishing purpose. Each pillar provides ideas, proposals and tools to establish a working environment that ensures employees’ wellbeing. The initiative also includes 120 models that can be implemented in the workplace, and act as executive instruments for meeting the requirements of the Workplace Happiness and Wellbeing Guide, launched by the National Program for Happiness and Wellbeing in March 2018.

The Health and Wellbeing Pillar focuses on ideas to enhance workplace wellbeing by promoting mental and physical health, emotional intelligence, psychological flexibility, and mindfulness.

The workplace wellbeing models offer practical applications to achieve balance in professional life, and establish an environment that embraces best practices and promotes wellbeing.

In this pillar, the models focus on professional workplace relations and their role in enhancing workplace wellbeing by promoting a positive team spirit and establishing a culture of effective communication.

The pillar also concentrates on the reciprocity between workplace wellbeing and good professional relationships, as well as the impact it has on performance levels. It provides a range of tools and ideas to strengthen workplace bonds and boost performance and productivity.

The Achieving Capacities pillar highlights the importance of empowering employees, building their capacities, and developing their skills, which, in turn, promotes workplace wellbeing and paves the way for further ideas and programmes to develop human resources and improve efficiency and performance.

This pillar highlights practices that catalyse achievement in the workplace, which include recognising and celebrating accomplishments, providing learning and development opportunities, and constantly motivating staff members.

This pillar is geared towards clearly establishing the link between individual purpose and corporate goals. It seeks to integrate employees’ individual purpose for a meaningful life and career, with the organisation’s vision, which seeks to achieve a set of stated objectives.

Establishing a common purpose enhances workplace wellbeing and boosts performance and productivity, by drawing attention to the importance of the common goals all team members are working to achieve.

Labor issues,Dubai,"The UAE continued to generate new jobs during most of 2018 with Dubai emerging the brightest spot in the country's employment market.

According to data from the Central Bank of the UAE, employment eased in the third quarter, growing moderately by 0.6 per cent compared to an increase of 1.2 per cent in the second quarter. Accordingly, employment rose by 1.6 per cent during the first three quarters on average, compared to a 2.6 per cent increase during the same period in 2017.

Quoting data from the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation, the central bank report said that total employment in the UAE was 5.025 million, of which 51.3 per cent are based in Dubai, 27.5 per cent in Abu Dhabi and 21.2 per cent in the Northern Emirates.

Dubai was the main driver for growth in the labour market during 2017 and in the first three quarters of 2018, with an average quarterly growth rate of 0.8 per cent. The emirate created 45,900 new jobs in the first three quarters with a growth rate of 1.8 per cent compared to the end of 2017. However, employment growth rates in the emirate started to pick up in the third quarter of 2018, reaching a quarter-on-quarter growth around 0.7 per cent compared to 0.03 per cent in the previous three-month period.

Abu Dhabi, meanwhile, had an average drop in employment growth during the first three quarters of 2018 by 3.3 per cent compared to a 0.7 per cent growth during the same period in 2017.

Similarly, in the Northern Emirates, employment decreased by 0.46 per cent in the third quarter on a quarter-to-quarter basis, compared to a decline of 0.86 per cent in the second.

Suhail Masri, vice-president of employer solutions at Bayt.com, said Dubai and Abu Dhabi emerge as the top cities in terms of job availability in the Mena region. The two emirates are also the top cities in terms of benefits for working parents.

""Dubai and Abu Dhabi are all rated highest on ability to find skilled and well-educated talent to employ,"" he added.

Pankaj Mundra, co-founder of Nimai Group, said all seven emirates have taken various initiatives in the last few years to promote employment but Dubai remains the favourite destination for expats, as well as new investors and employers.

Sectors' performance

According to the central bank data, employment in the construction sector, which accounts for around 30 per cent of the total workforce in the UAE, moderated at a downward pace as it increased jobs by 1 per cent. Real estate and other sectors reached 4.4 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.

The construction and real estate sectors together absorb around 46 per cent of the labour force in the UAE. Employment in both sectors eased to 1.9 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2018, against a 2.8 per cent increase in the previous quarter.

Slower employment growth was mainly driven by the services sector - employing more than 20 per cent of the total - which decreased by 1.3 per cent in the third quarter, followed by manufacturing and transport, and storage and communication sectors, which declined by 1.1 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively.

Accordingly, employment growth rates in the UAE remained virtually stable with a quarter-on-quarter decline of 0.05 per cent in the third quarter, similar to the previous three-month period.

On a sectoral level, the construction, services and real estate sectors account for 67.9 per cent of total employment. The growth rates of employment in the construction and services sectors declined 0.1 per cent and 0.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter, respectively, while real estate witnessed an increase of 0.68 per cent in the third quarter.

Abhijeet Mukherjee, CEO of Monster for the Asia-Pacific, said technology-related occupations in the UAE have witnessed the most growth in 2018 at 25 per cent during the first three quarters of the year.

""The recent increase in hiring activity within the sector is no surprise given the UAE's rapid digital transformation, as well as the recent announcements of smart city mega projects like Sharjah's $6.5 billion Aljada Smart City. As Expo 2020 Dubai approaches, we are also seeing an influx of occupations related to advertising and marketing as Dubai continues to promote and position itself as an attractive global destination for tourism and FDI,"" said Mukherjee.

Masri said that based on employers' responses to the Middle East Job Index Survey, the real estate and construction sector (34 per cent) emerges as the industry that attracts top talent across the UAE, followed by advertising, marketing and public relations (32 per cent), banking and finance (30 per cent), engineering (26 per cent), IT (24 per cent), business consultancy (23 per cent) and telecom (21 per cent).

Mundra noted that contracting companies have employed and will employ as they get ready to deliver projects for Expo 2020.

""Hospitality and tourism sectors continue to grow as Dubai and others emirates keep building new landmarks to attract tourists. The Dubai Frame, the Louvre Abu Dhabi and Noor Island in Sharjah are the new landmarks that have attracted tourists to stay one or two extra [days]. Ten years back a tourist will stay for four days in Dubai, which have just doubled to eight days, creating new job opportunities,"" he said.

In addition, there are also new opportunities for finance professionals due to the implementation of value-added tax. Senior finance professionals in Dubai will see opportunities in tax audit in 2019.

Labor issues,Dubai,"Migrant workers continue adding to the labour force of oil-rich Gulf due to mega-construction projects, UN data shows.

Blue-collar migrant workers continue adding to the labour force of the oil-rich Gulf, skewing long-standing efforts by its leaders to increase the percentage of its own citizens in the workforce, data of the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO) shows. Figures released this month in a 78-page study, ILO Global Estimates on National Migrant Workers, showed that the proportion of migrants in the eastern Arab region's workforce ballooned by 5.2 percent from 2013 to 2017, mostly in the construction sector. Migrants now make up 40.8 percent of the workforce across a 12-nation region that includes the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) bloc of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman. This is a much higher proportion than other rich regions that attract some of the world's estimated 164 million migrant workers. In comparison, migrants make up only 20.6 percent of the labour force in North America, and 17.8 percent in Europe. 171108145003698 In Dubai, Doha and other Gulf boomtowns, foreigners make up as much as 90 percent of workers, according to older figures. The ILO did not have data on separate countries for this month's report; Ryszard Cholewinski, the ILO's Beirut-based expert on migrant workers, said that figures provided by Gulf governments are often incomplete.

Blue collar jobs

The increase in labour flows to Gulf states these past five years was driven mainly by mega-construction projects, including pavilions for Expo 2020 Dubai and the Fifa World Cup 2022 stadiums being built across Qatar, said Cholewinski. Demand has also grown for maids, gardeners, drivers and other domestic staff, he added. In particular, more foreign carers are being hired to look after a growing number of elderly folks in their homes, as the Gulf population ages. ""The demand for male workers in the Arab states explains the sharp increase in the share of migrant workers in this region. Many of these workers are manual labourers, located mostly in the construction sector,"" Natalia Popova, an ILO labour economist, told Al Jazeera. ""Possible other reasons for the increase in the high share of migrant workers may include the increasing demand for domestic workers, both male and female, as well as for migrant workers in the hospitality sector.""

Nationalisation efforts

While data on nationalisation efforts is skewed due to the sheer amount of blue-collar migrants, Gulf leaders have long sought to boost the numbers of their working citizens, mainly in the white-collar workforce. However, state-led hiring drives, with such names as Qatarisation, Emiratisation and Saudisation, have had only limited success, particularly in the private sector, according to the ILO. ""Many of these nationalisation policies are not really having any impact. It's one of the region's big challenges,"" Cholewinski told Al Jazeera. 170609141743286 ""There's a lot of rhetoric on nationalisation [in for example Saudi Arabia's] Vision 2030 agenda. But in practice, this is going extremely slowly."" Al Jazeera contacted the UN missions of all six Gulf states by email and telephone over the course of several days, but was not able to get a comment on this issue. While each Gulf nation faces different challenges when it comes to nationalisation, many Gulf citizens loathe taking jobs in private companies, which cannot compete with the pension plans, generous holidays and shorter working hours in the cushy jobs-for-life enjoyed by civil servants. This can lead to odd distortions. A visitor to Dubai, the UAE's tourism hub, can spend their whole week-long vacation being served by migrant workers in shops, taxis and eateries, and the only Emirati they meet is a passport-stamping immigration clerk at the airport. Last month, the UAE launched it's so-called Citizen Redistribution Policy to temporarily shift civil servants into private sector jobs. It also rolled out training schemes for Emiratis and online recruitment tools. In recent months, Riyadh has introduced rules requiring shops to have Saudis in at least 70 percent of sales jobs. Expat workers pay monthly fees for their spouses and children, employers pay similar penalties for foreign employees. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 's ambitious Vision 2030 agenda aims to overhaul the Saudi economy by massively expanding the healthcare, education, recreation and tourism sectors and slash the high unemployment rates for young Saudis. John Shenton, chairman of the Chartered Institute of Building's Novus initiative, which supports construction jobs in Dubai, told Al Jazeera that Gulf nationalisation schemes were bearing fruit. In some state-regulated sectors, such as banking, legal and financial services, the number of local staff has grown, Shenton said. ""If the goal is to get more Emiratis in the workforce then it's having some effect,"" said Shenton. ""However there are other factors that will mean that those efforts may not be reflected in the data."" These gains are dwarfed by the mass-recruitment of foreign construction workers to build the skyscrapers, malls and artificial islands for which the region is famous, he added. ""At a site level, the chaps in safety boots and hard hats will always be from the subcontinent or South Asia,"" Shenton said. ""At the engineering and supervisory level, the skill set required can't be satisfied by the number of local graduates. The volume of work being undertaken and the discreet programme dates associated with projects like Qatar 2022 necessitate our hosts resourcing from overseas."" Melissa Roza, a headhunter at a Dubai-based recruitment firm, said nationalisation schemes had made gains in some white-collar jobs, but that state-set hiring quotas and penalty fees were also hurting these sectors. Banks in the UAE often prefer to pay fines for hiring foreigners than to cover the recruitment costs involved in hiring an Emirati, training them up and meeting their high salary expectations, she said. Executives have also found workarounds by hiring migrants via outsourcing firms, which do not affect the quota count, added Roza, whose name was changed so she could talk frankly on a hot-button issue.

Labor issues,Dubai,"Dubai's real estate downturn is forcing construction and engineering firms to cut jobs and halt expansion plans, in turn raising fresh risks for the wider economy. Known for its glittering skyscrapers and luxury villas, the Dubai property market is oversupplied, especially in the residential sector where prices have fallen steadily from a peak in mid-2014. Many towers stand half-empty, and some construction sites have been left dormant.

'We stopped expansion,' said Samer El Achkar, chief executive of Al Qabdah, which built the Kempinski Hotel on the man-made Palm Jumeirah island. Al Qabdah culled 10 percent of its roughly 7,400 workforce in June. 'We are trying not to reduce our employees but when we complete or deliver a project we let go of some employees if we don't need them in other projects,' El Achkar said.

A diplomatic row with former ally Qatar and sanctions against Iran, a major trading partner, have curbed foreign demand for property, while a new value-added tax has dragged on the domestic economy. A Reuters analysis of data from the Dubai Land Department (DLD) showed a 76 percent jump in the number of delayed developments and sales of villas and fl ats between 2016 and 2018.

The DLD told Reuters that 865 developers were registered with the department in 2018 but that only one in four had projects currently active. BNC, which provides news and data on the construction industry, estimates the value of delayed projects at $126.3 billion in 2018, up from $107.6 billion in 2017 and equivalent to about 16 percent of all projects this year.

The DLD declined to give 'private data' on struggling projects. While real estate schemes flounder, road and other core infrastructure projects backed by the government are going ahead as Dubai prepares to host the World Expo 2020 fair, expected to attract 25 million visitors.

Raed Safadi, chief economic adviser at Dubai's department of economic development, told Reuters: 'Investments targeted at Expo 2020 and beyond have given a fillip to the construction sector that continues to exhibit healthy growth rates, while at the same time increased supply in the market is putting cyclical pressure on the real estate sector.'

Developments

Projects are often dogged by stalled payments from developers, long a headache for builders in the region but one that has become worse as banks have become reluctant to extend more credit to the sector. Krisjanis Krustins, a director in the Middle East and Africa team at Fitch Ratings, said he had 'yet to hear a coherent thesis' for how Expo 2020 would sustain economic growth. Real estate and construction together accounted for 13.3 percent of Dubai's gross domestic product in 2017, according to the Dubai Statistics Center. Slumping property companies and contractors have helped make Dubai's stock market the worst performing in the Middle East this year, down about 24 percent.

Growth

'The construction sector has traditionally been a key source of growth for the wider economy, so any pressure on the industry would inevitably have an impact on both the rate of headline GDP growth and on other sectors that benefit indirectly from strong construction activity,' said Jean-Paul Pigat, head of research at Lighthouse Research in Dubai. The current situation is not comparable to the crash of a decade ago, which saw property prices fall more than 50 percent between 2008 and 2010 as the global financial crisis unfolded. But the outlook is grim. After falling 5-10 percent in 2017, real estate prices could decline by 10- 15 percent over the next two years, S&P Global Ratings said earlier this year. That is affecting construction firms and related contractors said Bishoy Azmy, CEO of Dubai-based Al Shafar General Contracting (ASGC).

'The reduction in the expectation of cost due to the pressure developers are facing and their own business model, means that contractors have to work at numbers that are even below their cost of a few months ago, or a few years ago,' Azmy said. 'The entire margin of the construction industry now is not enough.' The strain is visible at two of the Middle East's construction giants. Drake & Scull International (DSI), which has reported losses in eight of the past 10 quarters, has engaged advisers on a restructuring and new business plan.

Its shares are down nearly 84 percent year to date, while rival Arabtec Holding has fallen nearly 15 percent. Arabtec has hired investment bank Moelis & Co to work on a debt-restructuring plan, little more than a year after it raised 1.5 billion dirhams ($408.4 million) in a rights issue to wipe out accumulated losses. There was no response to requests for comment from Arabtec or DSI. The chief financial officer of an engineering consultancy active in Dubai for over a decade told Reuters 2018 had been a difficult year.

'We have had to resort to some layoffs. We laid off 25 percent of 145 employees mid-2018,' said the CFO, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Al Qabdah's El Achkar said the sector's problems had been exacerbated by banks squeezing financing for contractors and suppliers slashing their long-term payment options and asking for payment guarantees. 'We were obliged to inject more cash into our company from personal resources of shareholders to cover this cashfl ow shortage,' he said. Al Qabdah, which also has projects in the neighbouring emirate of Sharjah, is 'luckier than others in the market', El Achkar added.

Fuel prices are reviewed regularly but there is no intention to increase other energy prices in 2019, Jadaan added without elaborating. Under previously announced policy, domestic prices of fuels including gasoline, diesel and kerosene may be raised in 2019.

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is slowing a drive to cut its huge fiscal deficit in order to revive the economy, but the state budget plan for 2019 suggests it may not have room to boost growth by much. With unemployment among Saudis at a record 12.9 percent, creating jobs is becoming increasingly important to justify reforms launched over two years ago by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who aims to diversify the economy beyond oil exports.

The 2019 budget, released on Tuesday, reflected that. It promised a 7 percent increase in spending, which officials said would lift growth in the non-oil part of the economy and start bringing down unemployment from next year. But even that moderate rise in spending will come at a major cost, the budget plan showed: a dramatic reduction in the pace at which Riyadh shrinks the deficit, which it has pledged to eliminate entirely by 2023.

For three years ' ever since Riyadh ran an eye-popping deficit of 367 billion riyals ($98 billion) in 2015, or about 15 percent of gross domestic product, threatening its financial stability ' fiscal policy focused to a large extent on reassuring markets by cutting the deficit. The finance ministry said on Tuesday that the deficit shrank to 136 billion riyals or an estimated 4.6 percent of GDP this year, from 230 billion riyals in 2017.

Shrink

The 2019 budget, however, projected the deficit would shrink only marginally to 131 billion riyals or 4.2 percent of GDP next year. Many private analysts said the budget's spending and revenue numbers implied the deficit would actually rise. Bilal Khan, senior regional economist at Standard Chartered, predicted a deficit of 5 percent in 2019 and Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, forecast over 7 percent. Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, estimated that if oil prices did not rebound from current levels, the deficit would near 10 percent in 2019 ' a figure that Saudi Arabia could not sustain in the long run.

Labor issues,Dubai,"* The city of Dubai[https://www.businessinsider.com/category/dubai?utm_source=dowjones&utm_medium=ingest] in the United Arab Emirates is known for extravagant, newly built landmarks like the Burj Khalifa, the Palm Jumeirah[https://www.businessinsider.com/dubai-palm-jumeirah-artificial-island-2018-12?utm_source=dowjones&utm_medium=ingest], and the Dubai Mall[https://www.businessinsider.com/dubai-mall-worlds-second-largest-mall-2018-11?utm_source=dowjones&utm_medium=ingest].

* In just over two decades, the city has transformed from a desert backwater port to a thriving metropolis with the third-most skyscrapers in the world.

* While the rapid development has produced a futuristic city, it has come at the cost of hundreds of thousands of workers who suffered to build it.

Three decades ago, Dubai was little more than desert.

The city exploded in prosperity after the United Arab Emirates discovered oil in 1966, leading to a development boom that has resulted in the world's tallest building, the second-biggest mall[https://www.businessinsider.com/dubai-mall-worlds-second-largest-mall-2018-11?utm_source=dowjones&utm_medium=ingest], one of the most luxurious hotels, and more skyscrapers than any city besides New York and Hong Kong.

From the outside, Dubai looks like an unmitigated success story. But for those looking at Dubai and wishing their country or city would use it as a model, Dubai may be more of a cautionary tale.

The shiny, glass towers hide the trampling of the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers hailing from countries like Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.

Nearly 90% of Dubai's 3.1 million residents[http://www.atimes.com/article/gulf-grapples-with-silent-economic-crisis/] are expats, many of whom are migrant workers brought in to work on construction projects or in service jobs. Most come alone on the promise of much higher salaries than in their home countries, so they can send money back to their families.

But Dubai and the UAE have long been the subject of complaints of mistreatment of workers. Migrant workers say they often face brutal work conditions, shifts of 12 hours or more, and that companies withhold paychecks or workers' passports so as not to let them quit or return home.

Most workers are brought over by recruiters or recruitment agencies, many of which promise exaggerated salaries or job descriptions that differ greatly from what the workers end up doing.

The ""kafala,"" or visa sponsorship, system has been singled out as perpetuating[https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/united-arab-emirates] some of the worst abuse, by Human Rights Watch. The system requires employers to sponsor employees' visas for a fee, which the employers frequently pass on to workers.

Many workers are in debt to their employers for the cost of arranging their contracts, visa, and travel to Dubai, the New York Times found last year[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/dubai-frame-building-stolen-design.html].

Under the kafala system, if a worker tries to leave their job without permission, they can face fines, prison, or deportation. As a result, many have little legal recourse if they find themselves in a bad situation or one differing from what recruiters promised.

""There is a huge dependence on migrant workers who have employment terms that are no different than indentured servitude,"" Sarah Leah Whitson, the director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group that documents abuses of migrant workers, told The New York Times[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/dubai-frame-building-stolen-design.html] last year.

""This is a system that's put in place to entrap workers.""

In recent years, Dubai's government and the UAE have appeared to work to fix the situation.

Training sessions are now held regularly[https://gulfnews.com/uae/government/awareness-sessions-for-workers-in-dubai-1.2172557] to educate workers on their rights and the UAE has adopted a system to ensure on-time salary payment.

Last year, the country passed laws to establish working hours[https://www.khaleejtimes.com/news/government/uae-labour-laws-protect-workers-employers-equally---], paid sick leave, and stiff penalties for employers or recruitment agencies that fail to guarantee legal rights, use violence against workers, or fail to accurately convey the expected job description or salary to workers before bringing them to the country.

While recent reports from Human Rights Watch[https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/united-arab-emirates] and the United Nations[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/raises-concern-human-rights-uae-180110045834391.html] acknowledged improvements, both said labor abuses continue. HRW said the reform laws still allowed employers to charge workers the recruitment fees that can put them in debt.

Most of the workers come of their own accord, out of a serious need to make money because their home countries are impoverished. That makes it all the more tragic that the existing system seems set up to exploit them.

The knowledge of how migrant workers have suffered to make Dubai's vast constructed reality — which is more or less set up to fulfill a person's every whim, if you have the money to pay for it — makes it hard to recommend it as a place to put your tourist dollars.

Labor issues,Dubai,"Dec. 13 -- His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, witnessed, with the attendance of H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, the graduation ceremony of the new batch of graduates of the ""Mohammed bin Rashid Centre for Leadership Development Programme.""

Speaking on the occasion, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid said, ""I am happy to oversee the graduation of future leaders of the nation because they are the eyes with which we see our future and the hands with which we build our country. Creating leaders is the goal of a successful nation, and our journey is in constant need of new generations of leaders, to keep pace with the ambitions of our people.""

""Training new leaders will add new ideas and initiatives to our country's development and will guarantee our ongoing advancement, which relies on our efforts to create new leaders,"" he added.

The graduates presented their projects to His Highness Sheikh Mohammed, who praised their ideas and efforts and showed his support for two ideas to establish two non-government organisations, which will offer innovative social services.

The first organisation aims to hire unemployed Emiratis and offers its services to government and non-governmental organisations at competitive prices. The second will offer home care services for the elderly at prices that are 10 percent less than the market price.

The centre reflects the academic leadership of Sheikh Mohammed, which aims to train national leaders, in cooperation with leading international universities, who can keep pace with international developments and achieve his vision.

Based on the directives of H.H. Sheikh Mohammed to promote the role of the centre's graduates, an announcement was made in November stating that 35 of the centre's graduates were appointed in 35 boards of directors of civil organisations in Dubai, to supplement the UAE's social sector with new national leaders.

Over 12 months, the graduates of the programme participated in over 120 lectures, visits and workshops, as part of three leadership courses conducted by three leading international universities, which are the University of California-Berkeley, the International Institute for Management Development, IMD, in Switzerland, and Imperial College London.

They also made two international visits to San Francisco and Estonia, including to the headquarters of Ford, Tesla and Uber, and met with the President of Estonia and the Speaker of the Estonian Parliament.

The centre will launch new programmes at the start of 2019.

The participants of the programme's previous edition underwent comprehensive exams and interviews, and an executive mentor was allocated for every participant during their training to monitor their progress.

The programme's previous edition included 19 activities that were divided over three major courses, four physical courses, and three psychological courses, along with nine executive guidance sessions.

Labor issues,Dubai,"DUBAI, 13th December, 2018 (WAM) -- Dubai Tourism has announced plans to further drive industry Emiratisation efforts to create a strong pool of local talent that will play a key role in helping Dubai achieve its Tourism Vision 2025.

As guided by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, nationalisation initiatives launched by Dubai Tourism’s vocational education institution, the Dubai College of Tourism, DCT, continue to raise awareness among prospective young job-seekers within the local community, offering opportunities to pursue tourist-facing roles across diverse sectors. Under these initiatives, students can learn practical skills in a variety of disciplines, including hospitality, retail and entertainment.

One of the successful DCT initiatives offering Emirati job-seekers robust recruitment, training and industry on-boarding is the Medyaf programme. Launched in 2017, the comprehensive course encourages young nationals to join the tourism industry, preparing them for a suitable career based on their skills and competencies.

Mariam Al Maeeni, Director of Industry Nationalisation at DCT, said, ""Dubai Tourism’s efforts in increasing Emiratisation levels within the sector is in line with Dubai’s tourism strategy to attract 25 million visitors by 2025 and to further enhance the city’s position as the destination of choice for global travellers.""""We recognise how crucial it is to prime the next generation of UAE nationals for career opportunities in the sector, meeting the increase in demand for a skilled and qualified workforce which is able to provide authentic experiences that truly showcase Dubai’s local hospitality,"" she explained adding that to achieve these goals, ""we have introduced more initiatives to support the Medyaf platform, as well as to correct common misconceptions that prevail among the local population on taking up a career in tourism. Today, UAE Nationals are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of this industry and how it contributes to the development of their city.""The guidance and training offered includes a career counselling service; the popular Emirati Tour guide programme; the summer/winter programme dedicated to school students gaining direct industry experience via training workshops and activities; industry internships for university students and graduates; the volunteer service scheme that allows Emiratis to offer their time and talent at tourism and hospitality events; the skills development initiative which seeks to bridge the gap between the knowledge and skills of candidates and needs of the industry and employer; and regular awareness sessions held throughout the year for the benefit of the community, to help give them a better understanding of the tourism sector.

""We are pleased that the various initiatives we have introduced, and continue to implement, in collaboration with our stakeholders have been so well received. Many university and high school graduates who have completed our training programmes have already found employment in different roles including tour guides, front office jobs in hotels, receptionists and guest relations officers,"" Al Maeeni added.

Dubai College of Tourism has built strategic partnerships with key entities in private and government sectors to help job seekers find positions in the industry. The partnership between DCT and the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation cements its position within the framework of the national strategy. The collaboration and insights include the organisation of career-related events, activities and training workshops that reaffirm DCT’s commitment to working closely with stakeholders and partners as one team, to ensure the success of the initiative. Supporting this is DCT’s recent partnership with Dubai Airports, which aims to enhance levels of hospitality offered to tourists whilst travelling through

Labor issues,Dubai,"Whether that be a 'fireman's pole' connecting different levels in the office or 'skateboarding' in the workplace, offices in Dubai are getting inspired by the 'happy employee' policy.

The policy is being encouraged by the Dubai Government and employers are now taking the unconventional approach to redesigning workplaces inspired by the unorthodox work environments of Google, Apple or Facebook.

To actively engage their employees and to show 'we care', a growing trend is observed among the UAE employers that are innovating their policies and work space to improve the happiness, productivity and well-being of their workforce.

Apart from a number of government organisations, now the private sector firms are also joining the bandwagon, believing that breaking out of the cubicle - and even away from the desk altogether - can be a boon for creativity and productivity.

Fine Hygienic Holding recently chose to upgrade its Dubai offices, and the group's new workspace across two floors - located in Dubai's Jebel Ali Free Zone - employs an open-plan layout that gives the office a spacious and airy ambience while encouraging employees to more readily interact and collaborate throughout their workday.

""From bright colours, ample sunlight, rocking chairs, swings, skateboard ramp and in-office running track for employees to stay upbeat and active, to a meditation room and a solution room for those who need more stillness and reflection time, we brought in everything to help our employees feel the energy and love their workspace. This is because we spend more time in office than at home. So why not make it fun. The idea is to make them think out of the box and I want my people to get innovative,"" said James Michael Lafferty, CEO of Fine Hygienic Holding.

The firm is now a few weeks away from opening a corporate gym for its employees.

Based on its extensive research, workplace space analysis and an employee survey, Canon Middle East unveiled Canon's Space360 in April 2018, which is a one-of-a-kind initiative that is a basis for how the workspace is changing in the future.

Anurag Agrawal, managing director, Canon Middle East, said: ""When planning Canon Space360, the priority was to put Canon employees first because they are the talent and minds that drive innovation; and to achieve this objective, the workplace has to reflect the needs of today's working environment.""

Canon's Space360 is a fully functional, innovation-led space that is divided into three sections: Innovation, Knowledge and Community, with each having specific functional features and equipped with the latest technology to enable communication, messaging and engagement via various media. ""After opening of Canon Space360, we are observing a change in mindsets and a more optimistic and productive atmosphere in the office. And the positive, happy energy is contagious,"" Agrawal added.

Simone Beretta, head of human resources, Robert Bosch Middle East, said: ""At Bosch, we firmly believe in promoting a work-life balance, which is why we have instituted several initiatives, such as flexible working hours and work-from-home options. Employees have the freedom to start work at any time between 7am and 10am to accommodate any family obligations that they may have.

""We have also improved our maternity leave policy, doubling the allowance mandated under the UAE law, providing them with 14 weeks of maternity leave, and flexible working hours for up to a year post-partum. New mothers at Bosch can also opt for up to three months of unpaid leave.""

The company also ensures its associates are able to take part in different sport activities with colleagues, be it football, badminton, table tennis, jogging, or any other. In addition, the company regularly hosts talks and sessions on various medical topics ranging from diabetes to breast cancer and mindfulness, amongst others.

Interior designer Veena Kanchan said she has seen a greater demand in such employee-friendly office setups, and her latest ventures on these lines has been Fine Hygienic Holding as well as Rove Hotels.

""The idea of workplace has changed from the past couple of years. Market is maturing and employers are looking outwards to the world to take inspiration from better practices and trends. The human connection is being given much more importance than before,"" added Veena.

""DSC has already kicked off the field works of the survey which is one of the most important annual household surveys. It is scheduled to be carried out as part of Dubai's statistical plan and in large it will part of a national project covering all regions of UAE in coordination with the local statistical centers in each emirate,"" Al Muhairi stated.

He added: ""This survey is important for it provides the basic information on the labor force size and their social, economic and demographic characteristics in the manner that enables the decisions makers to set plans for developing human resources, identify the size of the available labor within a certain period of time and their relevance to the requirements and needs of the labor market.""

Data

""The significance of this survey lies in that it will provide detailed data on the various characteristics of Dubai's population and human resources in general, in addition to economically active residents and their characteristics in particular,"" Al Muhairi stated. He also underlined that such data will facilitate developing policies, plans and programs dedicated for labor market and the Emirati and non-Emirati labor force in the Emirate of Dubai.

Mohammed Al Mulla, Director of the Statistical Surveys & Frames Department, stated: ""Our team tasked to conduct Labor Force Survey will go on in their field works until mid-December 2018 and timings specified for visits are 04:00 p.m. until 09:00 p.m.""

Al Mulla further explained that the DSC's field researchers hold a valid ID issued by DSC showing all their personal information and wear the official uniform in red and grey colors vest. He stressed: ""It is important to verify the identity of the researcher prior giving any piece of information to any person. Any individual who does not hold his/her ID or not wearing the uniform does not represent the DSC and the case should be reported immediately; unless otherwise they presented what proves that they are qualified to collect the respondent's personal information.""

Goals

Noteworthy, the Dubai's Labor Force Survey 2018 aims at identifying the various demographic, social and economic characteristics of population and manpower, including rates of participation in the economic activity, the occupational structure and economic activity of employed individuals, as well as their job status.

Moreover, the survey aims to measure the unemployment rates according to the various characteristics, to provide data on the unemployed and employed based on their specialties and academic qualifications, to identify the methods and ways adopted by the unemployed to get an opportunity to work or getting a job and to identify changes in key indicators and characteristics over the past years.

Labor issues,Dubai,"Sheikh Mohammed, accompanied by Sheikh Hamdan, Sheikh Maktoum and Sheikh Ahmed, meeting Borge Brende at the World Economic Forum conference in Dubai on Sunday.

(Wam)

GCC youth don't get jobs because they are not equipped with the right kind of skills and relying on degrees and diplomas, experts said at the World Economic Forum conference in Dubai on Sunday.

""Skills will become the main currency of the labour market. Generally, people assume that if they have got a degree from the right kind of university that somehow translates into a job. That is often not true. If Gulf countries want true meritocracy in the labour market, they need to switch to skill-based currency as opposed to relying on degree and diplomas. We need to look at both emerging jobs and emerging skills,"" said Saadia Zahidi, head of the Centre for the New Economy and Society at the WEF, during a panel discussion.

His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, inaugurated the event in Dubai on Sunday. He also received WEF president Borge Brende during the third annual meeting of the Global Future Councils.

Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai; Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai; and Sheikh Ahmed bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, also attended the opening ceremony.

""Advanced technologies and sciences are shaping the future. In the UAE, we are keen to harness advanced technologies to enhance the progress of humanity,"" Sheikh Mohammed said.

""We are proud of the UAE's contribution to humanity's journey of progress, and its transition to a future driven by new advanced technologies. We are working hard to equip future generations with the skills that will be required in the future. Hosting the annual meeting of the Global Future Councils is part of our vision for enhancing the UAE's contributions to improving the conditions of human society. It reflects our aspirations and our constant efforts to ensure the best possible future for our people,"" he said.

Zahidi said some parts of unemployment in the Gulf region are structural unemployment. In other cases, the young people who are seeking jobs might have a job on paper that matches with their supposed degree. But the reason they don't get it is because they don't have right kind of skills - they don't know how to work as a team, how to present themselves, how to conduct in a workplace and don't have great marketing skills for themselves or for the company they are joining.

""There are a number of these 'software skills' - critical thinking, analytical thinking and active listening - which are often missing in the education system of the region whether it is kindergarten level, primary, secondary or university. So there is a need for reforms,"" she told Khaleej Times during an interview on the sidelines of the forum.

She pointed out that jobs related to software and application developer, analysts, data analysts, sales and marketing professionals, general operational managers, sales representatives, financial analysts, human resource specialists, assembly and factory workers and financial and investment advisors will be demand over the next four years.

These are the kinds of roles that are coming up but they are not all technology-specific roles.

Andrew McAfee, principal research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, emphasised that innovators and entrepreneurs create more jobs than they destroy.

""They are the job-creation engine. In the countries with high employments, the huge majority of jobs come from the private sector. We need robust education to deliver what people need. We need excellent infrastructure as most of it is crumbling. We need government to support basic research,"" he said.

He said there are a one million layoffs a month in the US as the country doesn't face quantity job problem but quality job problem. ""We need to teach critical thinking but we don't know how to do it.""

Speaking during the panel discussion, Mariana Mazzucato, professor of economics of innovation and public value, University College London, said that the hoarding of capital is affecting the job market. ""When you have $2 trillion in the US and $2 trillion in Europe in hoarding that hurts jobs market,"" she said.

Labor issues,Dubai,"DUBAI, 5th November, 2018 (WAM) -- Nasser bin Thani Al Hamli, Minister of Human Resources and Emiratisation, and officials and representatives of several retail sector companies discussed their efforts to achieve Emiratisation and create retail job opportunities for UAE nationals, as part of the second phase of the special job creation systems launched in mid-September.

The meeting is Al Hamli’s second with the retail sector, and is part of a series of meetings with companies from various economic sectors targeted by the initiative, which aims to create 3,500 job opportunities in 100 days, including 500 jobs in the insurance sector, and 1,000 jobs in other sectors that include finance and banking, tourism and retail.

Around 340 jobs have so far been created in the retail sector.

Al Hamli said that encouraging the employment of UAE nationals is a priority of the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation, and is in implementation of the directives of the Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, to accelerate the Emiratisation process.

He also noted that the ministry launched the ""Specialised Emiratisation Acceleration and Direct Employment Initiative in Targeted Strategic Sectors,"" which is based on developing partnerships with targeted sectors, in light of the joint responsibilities of UAE nationals and the community and their role in achieving Emiratisation.

During the meeting, which was recently held at the headquarters of the Government Accelerators in Dubai, Al Hamli highlighted the ministry’s commitment to assume its responsibilities according to the partnership, by supporting relevant companies and institutions and helping them to create more job opportunities for UAE nationals in the private sector, to achieve the Emiratisation objectives in the national agenda of the UAE Vision 2021.

Labor issues,Dubai,"Nov. 4 -- Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has endorsed 'Dubai Careers App' as an official platform for offering vacancies. The step supports the government efforts to rank Dubai as the smartest and happiest city in the world.

""RTA's endorsement of the 'Dubai Careers App' will enhance the user's experience through providing a standardized platform for both human resources staff and job seekers,"" said Mansour Al Falasi, Director of Human Resources and Development at RTA's Corporate Administrative Support Services Sector.

The process enables the integration with various social media channels, such as LinkedIn Business Page. This integration will considerably save the time, effort and cost, and enable the HR & Development Department to screen and select the most talented and competent applicants, thanks to the implementation of the top international standards of attracting talents in the system.

The system is easy to access and use through various smart devices. It reflects the commitment of RTA to implement the Dubai Government initiative and enhances the sustainability drive of 'Paperless Government.' The systems eliminates the use of paper forms in the recruitment process and replaces them by e-forms.

""The endorsement of the system for offering RTA's vacancies will enhance the integration with the Government Resource Planning System and the Business Intelligence, and generate several reports when needed. The system is configured with social media channels highlighted by LinkedIn Business Page, and avails of several other inherent benefits such as video interviews and the use of Artificial Intelligence features,"" added Al Falasi.

Labor issues,Dubai,"Bridging the gap between investors and startups is something that is not only a high-risk business venture, but involves high rewards too - and this is exactly evident from the efforts undertaken by Hardika Mehta, partner for community building (Dubai) at ah! Ventures, who is striving to strike right deals in the region through her platform SMARTup.

""We started off our initiatives in the UAE by bringing our interaction platform SMARTup to Dubai in June in association with in5. SMARTup is a joint initiative of ah! Ventures with meetingsandoffices.com,"" she says.

""ah! Ventures is India's largest early-stage investor network with more than 50 funding deals totalling about $20 million in the last few years with 1,900 investors. meetingsandoffices.com is India's largest aggregator community platform for coworking and flexible workspaces present across more than 18 cities in the country with more than 120,000 seats. SMARTup is a platform that focuses on creating quality conversations between early stage startups and prospective investor and mentors. This has been a huge success in India and Dubai was our first international foray,"" says Hardika.

The platform recently organised an event in Dubai, giving a platform to almost 20 investors from India and the UAE's local fraternity with a participation of 15 startups.

""We are an international early-stage platform with an investor network from around the globe, including Dubai and other UAE centres. We find this to be a flourishing and progressive market with some wonderful startups and excellent support initiatives. We are currently exploring how we may add maximum value to this vibrant ecosystem. While we have an investor base here already, our organised presence in the UAE is still work in progress and I am leading that exploration. I am on look out for capital efficient companies with a unique product or service filling an urgent market need,"" she stresses.

Hardika opines that she met a significant number of women entrepreneurs, building businesses not just for the UAE but also targeting international markets. Some of these have had very robust and interesting business plans and Dubai is an encouraging market for women entrepreneurs.

Asked on how she balances work and home, she says: ""Balancing family and work is a top priority for me, and I treat it as such. I actually put specific family time and events on my calendar so that precious time is dedicated and properly blocked off from any work that may try to sneak its way into my schedule,"" says Hardika.

ah! Ventures is currently focusing on initiatives that are limited to community outreach and connecting interfaces.

""We are encouraging UAE startups and investors to interact more actively with their counterparts in other parts of the world, especially India, where we are headquartered. We are looking forward to firming up further our investor base in the UAE for which I am actively holding conversations,"" Hardika adds.

""We are also looking to create a platform for not just the UAE but for Mena startups as well as those from Africa to showcase themselves at valuable investor and mentor interfaces. We created our first community interface called SMARTup between startups and our investors in June and had a very positive and encouraging response. We have plans to repeat these interfaces in coming months,"" said Hardika.

Her ambition to establish a strong platform that bridges the gap between investors and startups makes her believe that to attain higher heights one does need to dream big.

""Dream big and chase your dreams. You can't raise your net worth until you raise your self worth, so my biggest advice would be to lift yourself up high and follow your dreams. The world is ready and welcoming,"" Hardika concludes.

Keep this in mind:

. The core of business today depends on building valuable networks and constantly creating value for others that do business with you

. Staying focused on creating value rather than being transactional has worked both for me individually as well as for ah! Ventures, meetingsandoffices.com and SMARTup

. Getting started is important; the willingness to start is the smallest thing that makes the biggest difference

. Don't ever take a short cut, there is no alternative to hard work

Labor issues,Dubai,"DIFC - Dubai, October 10, 2018 -- Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries' labour market nationalisation policies aim to provide more jobs for a rapidly growing population, but they are also likely to raise labour costs and hamper diversification, Moody's Investors Service said in a report this week.

The report, ""Sovereigns -- GCC, Labour market nationalisation aims to curb unemployment but may raise labour costs and hamper diversification"", is available on www.moodys.com[http://www.moodys.com]. Moody's subscribers can access the report using the link at the end of this press release. The research is an update to the markets and does not constitute a rating action.

Rapid GCC population growth is leading to increased demand for jobs as new entrants join the market and only modest numbers of workers retire. Social changes will compound higher employment demand, particularly if more women enter the workforce.

Relative to the current size of the job market, the number of new jobs for nationals needed in the next two decades to meet labour market and social objectives is highest in Saudi Arabia (A1 stable), Oman (Baa3 negative) and to a lesser extent Kuwait (Aa2 stable).

""The size of the challenge is greatest where nationals comprise a relatively large share of their total populations, unemployment is relatively high, and there is less capacity to absorb new entrants into the public sector. Amongst the GCC these conditions apply to Saudi Arabia and Oman in particular"", said Thaddeus Best, a Moody's Analyst and co-author of the report.

By contrast, despite their young demographics, pressures are less marked in the UAE (Aa2 stable) and Qatar (Aa3 stable), where expatriate numbers are higher relative to nationals which indicates greater scope to create jobs for nationals as long as skills requirements are met.

Nationalisation strategies can have both credit positive and negative implications for sovereigns. It will be credit positive if these strategies are effective in providing wider job opportunities for nationals, while preventing a rise in unemployment and as a result maintain social and political stability.

However, large increases in public sector wage bills for the government to accommodate an increasing number of nationals in the administration would reduce fiscal flexibility and in some cases weaken fiscal strength. Bans and quotas could increase labour shortages, while a rise in labour costs as the private sector at least partially closes the wage gaps with the public sector in order to employ nationals would hamper competitiveness.

Social and political tensions could rise if the nationalisation plans fail to increase employment sufficiently. Nonetheless, the authorities will find it challenging to create sufficient private sector opportunities to halt rising unemployment, at least over the near-term.

Mode 5: Abu Dhabi fast becoming Washington's closest Arab ally

The UAE's adoption of the latest US encryption techniques brings the country closer to the inner circle of US military allies - while making sales of the F-35 to the UAE practically a foregone conclusion.

{{illustration(grande,centre)}}12706{{/illustration(grande,centre)}}Mode 5 poised for launch - The military alliance between the US and the United Arab Emirates has moved into a different league of late. Various defence and intelligence sources have told Intelligence Online that Abu Dhabi is about to be equipped with Mode 5 systems, the most recent version of the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) military air traffic control system used by the US military and its allies to identify one another's aircraft and vehicles. Mode 5, which has been developed by NSA technicians to improve the performance and security of the IFF system, uses state-of-the art modulation, coding and cryptographic techniques as well as providing expanded data-handling capabilities.

The technology is only shared with the US' closest military allies, NATO members, Japan, Brazil and Israel. Although it represents the NATO future standard for all military transponders and interrogators, some NATO countries have only recently started to equip their aircraft with Mode 5 technology, putting them behind the UAE right now, which has been installing it with the help of a team of engineers from the NSA. Only one other country in the Gulf region, Oman, may also be invited to upgrade its fleet of F-16 fighter planes to include the Mode 5 IFF system. Saudi Arabia could also soon join the club.

Internal upheavals - One major consequence of this development is that Abu Dhabi has essentially ruled out acquiring materiel that will not be compatible with Mode 5 technology, which is built by only a handful of US and European companies. The UAE is also calling for compatible systems to be installed when in service aircraft are due for retrofit. The development has also had an impact on Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I), systems, both Network Centric Operations and technical intelligence systems such as ELINT and SIGINT, as well as geospatial intelligence, or GEOINT, systems.

The alliance with the US does not only concern encryption but also content. The flow of information between the two countries, notably intelligence gathered by the NSA, is constantly on the increase.

This technical boost was agreed to in a deal between US President Donald Trump and Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan when they met in Washington in May 2017. As well as pledging to increase intelligence sharing and strengthen inter-operability, the defence deal that was signed included a number of other arrangements such as positioning US fighter planes in the UAE and the training of UAE pilots, special forces and intelligence personnel (IOL 783).

Commercial advantage - While Italy's Leonardo and France's Thales can carry out Mode 5 upgrades on European and US-allied aircraft in Asia-Pacific - Japan, South Korea and Australia - the supplier the best placed remains Raytheon, which is already working on some of the UAE's most critically significant systems (IOL 792).

The F-35, which Lockheed Martin is looking to sell to the UAE, comes with Mode 5 technology already installed. An order would therefore tie the UAE Air Force definitively to the Pentagon, notably due to its dependence on the F-35's Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), the cloud system that continually sends technical data from aircraft back to Lockheed Martin.

Privacy issues,Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, 29th October, 2018 (WAM) -- A draft federal law concerning the use of information and communications technology in the health sector will come under discussions during the second session of the Federal National Council, FNC, on Tuesday.

The FNC held the first procedural meeting of its 4th ordinary session of its 16th legislative chapter at its headquarters in Abu Dhabi yesterday.

The draft law, which includes 31 articles, will also enable the Ministry of Health and Prevention to gather and analyse accurate information and ensure data safety and security.

Last April, the Parliament referred the bill to its Health and Environmental Affairs Committee to study the legislation and prepare a report on it. If passed, the law will be applied across the country including free zones.

According to the explanatory note of the draft law, the government aims to improve the performance of the country’s healthcare system, in light of its advanced scientific achievements and the global developments taking place in various areas. It also stressed that the quality of healthcare is linked to the necessity of utilising information and communication technology in the health sector.

As per the explanatory note, the draft law aims to place the necessary controls, to ensure the appropriate use of information and communication technology, facilitate communication between users and those involved in the health sector, and guarantee the rights of all involved parties. It also aims to identify their duties, as well as protect the safety and security of the health information.

Privacy issues,Abu Dhabi,"(GlobeNewswire) - Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT), a global leader in broad, integrated and automated cybersecurity solutions, today announced that the Abu Dhabi City Municipality (ADM) has deployed Fortinets solutions as a foundation to secure its critical networks and data across its headquarters and 45 branch locations in the city. The ADM has selected the Fortinet Security Fabric to gain end-to-end visibility, automation and control into its network, cloud applications and IoT devices and to help protect its critical network from known and unknown attacks.

The Abu Dhabi City Municipality is an efficient municipal system ensuring sustainable development and enhancing the quality of lifecriteria for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Its main mission is to achieve and deliver best-in-class efficient and customer centric municipal services by engaging with the community and partners.

With ADMs critical network and data assets spread across its headquarters and 45 branches in the city of Abu Dhabi, most of its existing security solutions were in silos. This meant limited visibility and control over the network and devices. With an increase in IoT vulnerabilities, ransomware, and enterprise application threats, it became imperative for ADM to have a single security platform to secure its network and data, which includes sensitive information on Lands & Proprieties Ownerships, City & Buildings Infrastructure, but also contains PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and intellectual property data.

We wanted to have a complete security strategy approach in one platform, ensuring a zero-trust model and positive security implementation. It was important for the solution to provide threat detection, prevention, and response capabilities. It had to allow for internal segmentation, complete end-to-end visibility and superior protection from advanced threats, said Ali Mohamed Aljeadi, Head of IT Infrastructure and Security (CISO), at Abu Dhabi City Municipality.

After evaluating several solutions from vendors such as Cisco and Palo Alto Networks, ADM selected Fortinets FortiGate range of next-generation firewalls as it met its stringent selection criteria while providing a single-pane-of-glass management and reporting system, flexible features and integration capabilities with third party vendors via the Fortinet Security Fabrics open architecture, high performance and unmatched third party validation. The fact that Fortinet offered local technical assistance center (TAC) support had also a significant impact on ADMs decision.

Fortinet has provided us with a suite of solutions and a single-pane-of-glass approach for monitoring, managing, and reporting. The solution is easy to manage, allowing the security administration staff to focus on critical tasks, therefore reducing time to identify and mitigate threats. We also need fewer resources to manage the appliances, added Aljeadi.

A combination of Fortinets solutions have been deployed including FortiGate Next-Generation Firewalls (three high-end FortiGate 3200D, 24 FortiGate 300D, 45 FortiGate 81E, four FortiGate 30E), FortiSandbox 3000E, and FortiAnalyzer 1000E, across ADMs headquarters and 45 branches within Abu Dhabi City to secure close to nine thousand users.

FortiGate Next-Generation Firewalls provide ADM with Intrusion Prevention Systems, VPNs, URL Filtering, Web Antivirus, Anti-Spam, Anti-X, Antivirus and Sandboxing. ADM has also subscribed to Fortinets services, while utilizing the FortiAnalyzer to generate periodic reports for both C-level executives and the security team. The implementation took place in two phases with the datacentre and ATP being completed in Q1 of 2018, while the SD-WAN implementation for the headquarters and major branches was completed in Q2 of 2018.

We are delighted to see an almost immediate return on investment so early after implementation. Not only have we received high-end protection, but have also reduced our annual OPEX by more than 72 percent, while increasing our latency and network capacity fourfold. We have received significant business benefits in which our annual CAPEX of ISP for MPLS has reduced from 3.5 million dirhams to less than one million dirhams, said Aljeadi.

As we witness the convergence of IT and OT, securing tangible and intangible assets has become an important aspect of physical security. The ADM is a great example of how government establishments approach cybersecurity and trust the Fortinet Security Fabric to secure their mission-critical networks and data. We are proud to have the Abu Dhabi City Municipality as a prestigious addition to our customers in the public sector, said Alain Penel, Regional Vice President - Middle East, Fortinet. ADM will benefit from the Fortinet Security Fabric approach with actionable intelligence, integrated network intrusion prevention, application awareness and added firewall intelligence.

The FortiGate Next-Generation Firewalls have helped ADM resolve multiple challenges such as user identification, while improving SSL performance by enabling visibility and control of network activity on a per-user basis. It has resolved a content identification challenge to prevent data leakage and stop threats with detailed, real-time traffic inspection through threat prevention, URL filtering, and file and data filtering.

Finally, the intuitive FortiPortal web interface has reduced the learning curve for the security administration team and allowed them to efficiently manage the FortiGate appliances through a single-pane-of-glass approach. In addition, Fortinet carried out intensive training sessions for the team, while ADM has access to Fortinets FortiCare services.

Privacy issues,Abu Dhabi,"If crimes are sophisticated, so are the preventive measures and awareness campaigns. From a Dh1 million fine to jail sentences, cyber criminals are heavily punished in the UAE. Police officials in Dubai and Abu Dhabi have also launched several platforms where people can register complaints online, and the Telecommunications Regulations Authority (TRA) is also conducting simultaneous awareness campaigns, especially for the younger generations.

For example, in May this year, the Dubai Police launched e-crime.ae, an online platform for members of the public to report cybercrimes. These include suspicious emails, social media related issues, internet calls, hacking, online bullying and cyber-extortion. Colonel Saeed Al Hajari, director of the Dubai Police Cybercrime Department, said there were a few simple steps involved in submitting a report.

""Users must first determine whether the complaint relates to cybercrime or an online service. They will then need to enter their Emirates ID and contact numbers, confirm their number via a text message, fill in some personal details, and then provide details of the complaint,"" he explained.

He said that the service will provide a ""true and effective measurement of cybercrime"", and the number of complaints filed by the public will increase on a new platform.

Awareness campaigns

According to a report on Wam, the Abu Dhabi Police have warned the public about fraud messages on social media applications, such as WhatsApp, which imitate trademarks and trusted websites. This is being done with the aim of stealing personal information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers and other information that may lead to problems for users, who are required to report these crimes to the police, to track and catch the criminals.

The Security Information Administration of the Commandship Affairs Sector stated that through information received by the 'Aman' service, they were able to track complex telephone fraud operations, where fraudsters were able to steal their victims' WhatsApp accounts. These accounts are then used for other cybercrimes, including offering fake raffle prizes. The administration urged social media users to secure their accounts, so they cannot be used by others in electronic crimes.

The Dubai Police are organising a cybercrime awareness campaign from September 1 to September 30 this year, according to information on the Dubai Police website. The campaign aims at increasing awareness of both young people and parents about cybercrimes, urging caution while sharing data and photographs on the Internet to avoid crimes such as blackmail and misuse of information.

Reach out to youngsters

In a bid to reach young people, the TRA recently launched the 'Emirates Cyber Ambassadors Initiative' as part of its information security awareness campaigns, which aims to train elite students in UAE schools to represent the team as ambassadors in promoting and spreading cybersecurity awareness across the UAE.

The initiative focuses on three focus areas - to provide safe e-culture training for selected 14 to 18-year-olds in selected schools; to improve presentation skills; and to raise awareness of best security practices among the public.

Mohammed Gheyath, executive director, Information Security Regulatory Affairs, said: ""In line with the UAE Vision 2021 on promoting a secure electronic lifestyle in the UAE, we began the pilot phase of the Cybersecurity Ambassadors Initiative in February of this year. Training workshops were offered to students to evaluate their performance and readiness to join the list of cybersecurity ambassadors. The results were promising, which led us to complement the revision and selection of 30 male students and 30 female students to represent the initiative.""

The Security Information Administration of the Commandship Affairs Sector stated that through information received by the 'Aman' service, they were able to track complex telephone fraud operations, where fraudsters were able to steal their victims’ Whatsapp accounts, which they used to request an activation code through SMS. They also called their victims over the phone to find out the code and used the accounts in other fraud operations with other suspects, by claiming that they won prizes.

The administration urged social media users to secure their accounts, so they cannot be used in electronic crimes while highlighting the steps to secure their accounts, especially Whatsapp, and warning users to not click on any links unless they can verify the sender’s identity, as well as to not reveal any personal information on untrusted websites.

These types of fraud are becoming more advanced, but they are monitoring all the illegal ways to conduct electronic fraud, including the advertising of fake jobs for specific companies and institutions to steal money, the administration added.

The Cyber Crime Law will punish anyone who illegally steals money for themselves or any other person by fraudulently using a false name or misrepresentation through a computer network, electronic information system or information technology device. The penalty is imprisonment for between one year to three years and a fine of between AED250,000 and AED1 million.

The Federal Penal Code also punishes traditional ""non-electronic"" fraud crimes with imprisonment of between one to three months or a fine of between AED1,000 and AED30,000.

William Brown, Director of Crisis and Resilience Consulting in the Middle East and North Africa at Control Risks, stated that cyber security is a key element of business risks, and presented those issues related to corporate governance that concern boards of directors. He also discussed the role of vetting and risk committees in understanding and managing the cyber risk profiles of institutions, as well as international and regional feedback and research related to cyber security.

He added that cyber-attacks have become semi-routine and many leading financial institutions in Gulf Cooperation Council countries, GCC, aim to increase their investment in cyber security to protect the confidentiality of their clients, as well as their rights and investments from these attacks.

He explained that the European General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, which will come into force in May 2018, aims to protect the data of all individuals in the European Union, EU, and all companies in the Middle East with European clients will be affected. Therefore, it was decided to include it as part of the data protection regulations of the Dubai International Financial Centre and Abu Dhabi’s international markets, he added, while highlighting its necessity, in recognition of the rights of EU citizens to protect their personal data.

Brown pointed out that some of the key requirements of the GDPR include the completion of a comprehensive data evaluation, to achieve total data protection compliance, and the adoption of stricter policies to manage data, such as the presence of a data protection officer with the ability to control, manage and use data, as well as to generate and provide reports to stakeholders. The officer must also respond to requests for personal information or data to prevent the automatic reporting of security breaches, he added, while highlighting the necessity of increasing penalties for relevant violations to US$20.1 million, or four percent of business percentages.

Privacy issues,Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi-based cyber security firm DarkMatter unveiled its flagship secure Katim Android phone at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday, the latest element in what it describes as its ‘holistic’ approach to cyber security.

The device, first announced last February, has already begun shipping to UAE-based customers, DarkMatter chief executive officer Faisal Al Bannai told The National, with its initial run of a few thousand” handsets already having sold out.

Our first customer base that had the initial batch [of phones] is UAE-based, and we’ve been talking to a number of other customers,” said Mr Al Bannai. The interest we’ve got is from GCC and outside from the Far East and Europe.” He declined to give further details.

Cybercrimes cost global businesses between $445-600 billion per year, up from between $345-445bn in 2014, according to research published last month by cybersecurity company McAfee and US-based think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies. As illegal activities go, cybercrime’s impact trails only government corruption and narcotics trafficking in its economic impact, the research estimated.

The Katim phone forms a part of DarkMatter’s Katim cybersecurity suite, first unveiled at last year’s Mobile World Congress. _______

The 5.2-inch Katim uses a hardened version of the Android operating system, whose features includes a full software stack check when the device is booted, a data-wipe function in case of a serious security breach, and shield mode to disable recording functions.

Mr Al Bannai stressed that a secure Android device alone could not protect corporations and governments from cyberattacks.

If we only had to rely on [Android security updates] then everyone in this hall would be okay from a security point of view,” he said, referring to other mobile manufacturers showcasing their latest handsets.

You need to look at your systems, your network, your apps, the process by which it was implemented, all of it together.

New mobile malware grew by 60 per cent globally year-on-year in the third quarter of last year, according to McAfee, fuelled by a big increase in Android screen-locking ransomware.

Mr Al Bannai noted that major online breaches worldwide had increased exponentially” over the past 48 months, compared with the previous period of the same length, even as spending on cybersecurity continues to rise.

The sophistication of criminals or governments is increasing, but it’s also because customers are trying to find a silver bullet to solve their security issues,” he said.

You can’t solve it unless you have a holistic approach to security.”

DarkMatter also announced the availability of its Katim email application, enabling end-to-end encrypted communication between Katim users, with external users able to participate via secure web access.

Privacy issues,Dubai,"Vital signs of passengers coming into Dubai will soon be screened while they pass through smart gates equipped with thermal cameras at the airports. The upcoming 'Smart Health Tracks' are currently at the proof of concept stage and will be tested soon. A model of the smart gate was displayed at the Arab Health Congress and Exhibition that kicked off on Monday.

Ali Al Ajami, director of IT department at the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP), told Khaleej Times that the step was being taken to ""prevent epidemic diseases"". ""It is like a normal smart gate which we will fit with thermal cameras that can read body temperatures,"" he said. ""The temperature limit is yet to be decided.""

The gates will also help share data of passengers coming into the country. Once a sick passenger is identified, the health ministry will put in place short-term measures to take care of the patient, said Al Ajami.

The Smart Health Track has been launched in collaboration with the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs, Dubai (GDRFA). The thermal cameras will be capable of detecting passengers' body temperature by scanning their face and body thermal print.

Data collected and passenger details will be registered on a shared database. This will grant the MoHAP access to passengers' data, which will be used when they visit any hospital in the UAE.

This new procedure will help reduce check-in time at hospitals. Furthermore, dedicated medical teams will be deployed at the Dubai Airports to provide necessary first-aid in emergency cases.

Major-General Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director-General, GDRFA Dubai, said that exchanging passengers' health data with the ministry will increase health service efficiency by reducing paper work and other administrative processes.

Dr Mohammad Salim Al Olama, undersecretary of the MoHAP, explained that while the project facilitates data exchange, it guarantees ""highest levels of privacy and data security"".

""Strict security policies and measures are implemented at hospitals and clinics to ensure confidential handling of all data,"" he said.

Privacy issues,Dubai,"New Delhi, Jan. 8 -- In April 2018, the department of economic development, Dubai, launched a ""Smart Protection"" service, which adopts Artificial Intelligence (AI) to respond efficiently to consumer queries and resolve their complaints. Through an app called Dubai Consumer, the service engages consumers in a direct dialogue to gather information and, within a few minutes, issues an ""empowerment letter"" stating details of complaint and instructions to the retailer to resolve relevant grievance within a pre-specified time frame, failing which the retailer risks attracting fines.

It was reported in November that retailers comply with instructions in empowerment letters in more than 90% cases. The service has been trained to handle grievances in more than 12 sectors and understands more than 40 laws and regulations relating to consumer protection.

Imagine the utility of such a service in our country, wherein the standard of customer support and grievance redressal is abysmally poor. Consumer courts suffer from infrastructure and capacity constraints and even simple matters drag on for years. Our experience of consumer grievance handling reveals stark information asymmetry among consumers and high opportunity cost of filing and pursuing complaints. The use of AI in addressing these constraints can go a long way in empowering consumers.

Alas, the discourse on AI has been captured by concepts such as bots surpassing human intelligence, ethical use of AI, and algorithmic bias. However, the potential of AI in empowering consumers must not be lost sight of. A recent paper by Giuseppe Contissa et al has done a huge service by bringing this issue into the limelight.

The need to empower consumers is now more than ever, given the unprecedented growth of the digital economy and global interconnectedness. Fortunately, awareness about consumer rights, especially privacy and data protection, has increased manifold owing to the Puttaswamy judgment and discussions around the draft personal data protection bill. Despite being aware, consumers lack adequate tools to protect their privacy and data. Measures hitherto suggested, such as increasing transparency by providing more information, may result in information overload and compound the asymmetry.

AI can help here as well. Tools like CLAUDETTE can be used for automatic detection of potentially unfair clauses in contracts and terms of service, and are being improved to assess compliance with data protection regulation. PriBot and Polisis provide AI-powered summaries and a free-form question answering system for privacy policies. However, these tools are being developed further, primarily interact in English, and require users to approach them to obtain information. These constraints may limit scalability in India.

Thus, there is a need of a bottom-up approach to leverage AI for Indian consumers. Can AI-powered privacy labels be designed that can present the most important terms and conditions, depending on consumers' likely profile and behaviour, in a format preferred by them, thus facilitating informed decision making? Can privacy policy reviewing tools automatically alert regulatory agencies of unfair terms to overcome consumers' lackadaisical attitude in enforcing their rights and filing grievances? Customized solutions contextualized to meet specific needs can go a long way in empowering Indian consumers.

The extraordinary progress in the digital economy coupled with smartphone penetration in the country has put consumers in the midst of an information deluge, making it difficult for them to compare products intelligently. AI-empowered personal assistants can help them navigate through exponentially growing data, reduce search and transaction costs, overcome biases, and enable more sophisticated choices. These tools may also help consumers assess the trustworthiness and helpfulness of online consumer reviews by analysing sentiment and polarity.

The day is not far when AI does not merely assist consumers in decision making but takes decisions on behalf of consumers. Michal S. Gal et al suggest that the next generation of e-commerce will be conducted by digital agents, based on algorithms that will not only make purchase recommendations but will also predict what consumers want, make purchase decisions, negotiate and execute transactions for consumers, and even automatically form coalitions of buyers to enjoy better terms, thereby replacing human decision-making.

Unsurprisingly, despite its potential in empowering consumers, the increasing role of AI in the lives of consumers is fraught with conceptual, moral, ethical and regulatory dilemmas. India's sociocultural and economic diversity may pose challenges and delay the mass utilisation of AI, but such time needs to be judiciously utilised in designing principles and frameworks to address related dilemmas.

The time to discuss such principles and frameworks is not in the future, but now. India is modernizing its regulatory frameworks on privacy and data protection, consumer protection, e-commerce. We cannot let go of this opportunity and need to be bold and forward looking to move collectively towards consumer-empowering AI.

He further added that ensuring a secured and integrated environment for data represents a main milestone in the success of future governments, as they will be able to leverage the enormous potentials of ""big data"". He stressed that this provides future governments with vital inputs that empowers them to develop their tools, work approaches and means of interaction.

The guiding framework for enabling a secured and integrated data environment is an important and essential tool to achieve the objectives of the 4IR Protocol. It also supports the 4IR Governance Agreement signed between the UAE Government and the World Economic Forum last January. The agreement aims at promoting mutual cooperation on the 4IR Protocol, setting organizational and legal frameworks to secure the 4IR sectors data governance; and developing mechanisms to adopt the 4IR tools and technologies.

The agreement further focuses on providing an integrated and secure data environment, where governments can ensure the privacy of community members. The Protocol itself, meanwhile, promotes values and ethics among the generations of the future to guide their use of data and applications of the 4IR as a means to address the challenges of the future and improve wellbeing.

In November 13th, 2017, the UAE Government launched the developmental works of the 4IR Protocol, in line with the second annual meeting of the Global Future Councils. The 4IR Protocol establishes a robust, integrated and secure data environment to embrace the 4IR and address the challenges it brings along. It catalyses the development of instruments and procedures to help governments seamlessly transition towards these avant-garde technologies, all the while setting policies and legislation to govern 4IR sectors – particularly, big data.

The Protocol embodies the UAE’s strategic vision for the 4IR, namely establishing the UAE as a world hub welcoming the drastic transformations of the 4IR, and an open laboratory for experimenting with its advanced technologies. The Protocol revolves around three main pillars: establishing an integrated and secure environment for data; formulating the policies and legislation to govern the 4IR diverse sectors; and promoting the values and ethics of the 4IR.

Privacy issues,Dubai,"Question: I work and live in Dubai. I had a query and hope you could help me out. Are dashcams legal in the UAE? As in, if some vehicle hits mine, can the footage from the dashcam be used as evidence to claim insurance? Also, I have seen some illegal activities going on in my area. Can I secretly film them and share them with the authorities? What should I do?

Answer: Pursuant to your queries, it is not illegal in the UAE to use dashcams on your vehicles as it will help you or the police and authorities in case of road accidents to figure out who is at fault. The dashcams should be purchased only from authorised sellers based in the UAE and installed and operated as per the regulations prevailing in the UAE. Dashcam recording in the vehicle should not be misused and circulated in public or to defame the owners of the cars. It should only be used as evidence during accidents and any criminal offence, which occurs within or around the vehicle.

It should be noted that one cannot secretly video record or photograph in public unless authorised by the local authorities. You should seek go-ahead of the public prosecution, as a whistleblower, that you intend to assist the local authorities in reporting them the illegal activities. The discretion rests with the public prosecution to approve your request and authorise you to record video or photograph secretly in public about illegal activities. It is apt that you report to the police regarding the illegal activities and inform them the location, so they will visit the site where these are being carried out based on your first-hand information. You should not record without the approval of public prosecution as you may yourself face criminal charges against you for recording video secretly in public. This is in accordance with Article 21 of the Federal Decree Law No. 5 of 2012 on combating cybercrimes, which states, ""One shall be punished by imprisonment for a period of at least six months and a fine not less than Dh150,000 and not in excess of Dh500,000 or either of these two penalties if he/she uses a computer network or/and electronic information system or any information technology means for the invasion of privacy of another person in other than the cases allowed by the law and by any of the following ways:

One shall also be punished by imprisonment for a period of at least one year and a fine of not less than Dh250,000 and not in excess of Dh500,000 or either of these two penalties if one uses an electronic information system or any information technology means for amending or processing a record, photo or scene for the purpose of defamation of or offending another person or for attacking or invading his privacy.""

Privacy issues,Dubai,"As the GCC region continues to move rapidly towards digital transformation and adopting technologies such as blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), it has become necessary for businesses and governments to implement cybersecurity services, experts say.

""As companies embark on their journey to digital transformation, they now see investing in cybersecurity as their top priority,"" said Mohammed Abukhater, vice-president for the MEA region at FireEye.

Speaking at the 38th Gitex Technology Week exhibition, he revealed that worldwide spending on information security products and services will reach more than $114 billion in 2018, an increase of 12.4 per cent from last year, according to the latest forecast from Gartner. In 2019, the market is forecast to grow 8.7 per cent to $124 billion.

""There will always be cybersecurity challenges and one of the major reasons for this is the lack of awareness of the importance of cybersecurity,"" he said. ""The positive side to this is that the government has put policies and protocols in place to strengthen Dubai`s position as a world leader in innovation, safety and security. Earlier this year, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, launched the Dubai Cyber Security Strategy, an initiative that aims to help businesses and individuals to create a safe cyber space, making Dubai`s cybersecurity experience a global model.""

Jawad Toukna, director, regional sales, emerging markets at Forcepoint, said the key when you want to protect something is to understand what all needs protection in order to put the right infrastructure in place.

""If you build it properly, you can avoid any kind of weaknesses within your network,"" he said. ""You need to make sure you are covering the basics of security, so whenever there is any new threat coming in, you only have to address that new threat - you don`t need to look for any backdoors from the past; you are looking for the future.""

Smart cities, he added, are not secured by architecture, but rather how you develop the architecture. ""For example, if you are building a house and don`t put the doors where they belong, then you are building a vulnerable house. If you start building your city with an eye and outlook for cybersecurity implementation, you can continue to stay up-to-date and steer clear of potential threats. We`ve found that 90 per cent of cyber security attacks or leakages are accidental - perhaps someone clicking on a link they didn`t know was malware. Nearly 10 per cent are malicious, which means people really want to leak the information and harm the company.""

For a smart city, he noted that there are applications where everyone and everything is connected. Whoever is managing the city has access to all this data.

""When you manage a smart city, you have access to critical infrastructure, national grid, electricity, gas and even police,"" Toukna said. ""If the wrong person has access to that infrastructure, they can take it down. We have seen this in movies but also in reality. In Ukraine, when the national grid went down during winter, there was no gas or electricity. At that time, the media were saying that it is a national cyber-attack - so that`s why security in smart cities is really critical; we need to protect that infrastructure.""

Privacy issues,Dubai,"Data breaches and cyber crimes are becoming more commonplace both in the Middle East and globally. The increasing need for protection against cyber attacks mean that cyber premiums will soon outpace those of all other insurance lines, says Mr Justin Whelan of Ince & Co Dubai.

The use of data is imperative for the functioning of all areas of 21st century business, whether in the systems of manufacturing, energy or agricultural industrial control; marine navigation or cargo tracking; air traffic control or aircraft operation; building management; healthcare and educational provisions; or financial institution transactions. It is also essential for the functioning of government and the smart cities that we will inhabit. 

The economic value of data is immense, and now outstrips the value of tangible physical assets in a number of industries, none more so than those in the sharing economy. This is illustrated within the hospitality business with Airbnb, and in the private hire transport business with Uber. 

The tremendous growth of these companies is based on data-led services versus physical products. Data is now so important that it has been described as the world’s most valuable resource, ahead of oil.   

The surge of cyber incidents 

It is not surprising that in recent years there has been a surge of global, high-profile cyber incidents of pan-sector data theft/disruption. The hacks on Amazon, Ebay, Equifax, Deloitte, Facebook, JPMorgan Chase, LinkedIn, Sony, TalkTalk, Target, Verizon, Yahoo, the US military, the UK Houses of Parliament and, most recently, Dixon Carphone in the UK and the cryptojacking of Coinrail (the Korean cryptocurrency exchange) highlight the unquantifiable value of data. Data breaches are occurring daily and indiscriminately worldwide. Regardless of size and location, no individual, business, organisation or government appears to be immune. 

The Middle East is no exception. Although data breach notification requirements in the Middle East are currently far less stringent than in Europe and the US, and consequently result in less widespread reporting of incidents, this does not mean that the region is unscathed. 

In 2017, the UAE’s Telecommunications Regulatory Authority thwarted 615 cyberattacks against government, semi-government and private sector entities, reported Emirates News Agency. Oman’s National CERT (Computer Emergency Readiness Team) reported having dealt with 1,800 cyber security incidents targeting organisations and individuals, and Saudi Arabia reported a new advanced persistent threat ‘PowerShell’ targeted at governmental computers. 

Within the Middle East, banks and power plants remain the most targeted industries. However, the April 2018 attack on Dubai’s Careem, and the ensuing data compromise of 14m users, portrayed how the risk is not limited to the financial and energy sectors. 

In terms of cost, the reported average organisational cost of data breach in Saudi Arabia and the UAE increased by 6.9% to $4.94m in 2017 with $1.43m spent on post-data-breach response. These figures are second only to the US and are an enormous risk for an organisation to carry.

Individuals are also at risk, and not just high-net-worth individuals. In 2017, more than 50% of the adult UAE population experienced online data loss at an average cost of AED669 per person and a total cost of AED4bn, reported The National. In the same year, the Abu Dhabi police force handled almost 800 cases of reported cybercrime, of which more than 200 are related to data-based blackmail, said the paper. 

Cyber security measures 

In view of these incidents, there is a rapidly growing awareness on cyber security in the Middle East. Governments are taking measures, and more companies are strategically assessing risks around cyber security and data protection. 

For instance, in 2017, Saudi Arabia issued a decree to set up a National Cyber Security Authority to protect ‘vital interest, national security and sensitive infrastructure’, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Jeddah launched its Cyber Security Centre. Oman’s National CERT has been appointed as a Cyber Security Centre for 21 countries across the Arab region. 

The UAE is the first country in the world to have created a Minister for Artificial Intelligence, and it has also established the pioneering Fourth Industrial Revolution Council, which aims to spearhead the transformation of this digital revolution into a worldwide movement. In readiness for Expo 2020, Dubai is positioning itself as a leading smart city with a number of initiatives such as Smart Dubai, Dubai Data, the Dubai Blockchain Strategy, the Dubai Internet of Things Strategy and the Dubai Cyber Security Strategy based on raising public awareness, innovative research, data protection control, cyberspace flexibility, and local and global collaboration. Echoing all of this is the estimation that the GCC’s cyber security market will increase to about $10.4bn by the end of 2022. 

Growth of cyber insurance

The paramount importance of data is being reflected in the growth of cyber insurance. In 2017, US premiums increased 54% and European premiums grew 25%, said The Wall Street Journal. 

Cyber premiums have increased by 23% annually over the last five years, according to Aon Inpoint’s June 2018 report. Aon also estimates worldwide cyber insurance premiums will have a value of $4bn by 2021, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 14.1%, and that cyber premiums will soon outpace those of all other insurance lines. 

The global growth in premiums follows the increase in claims, with AIG EMEA reporting a significant increase of cyber claims in 2017, which is equivalent to the total combined claims between 2012 and 2016. 

Better data protection 

Although the rise and rise of data is reflected in the cyber crime and electronic transaction laws of the Middle East, the same cannot be said for data protection law. Many of the countries in the Middle East and all the GCC states have invested heavily in having adequate IT crime and electronic transaction laws in place, and the GCC national laws are enhanced by the Arab agreement on combating IT crimes. While cyber-crime legislation criminalises data theft/disruption and the unauthorised disclosure of private data, it does not however impose data protection requirements on those who possess data. 

Within the GCC, Qatar has enacted a specific Data Privacy and Protection Law, while Bahrain has approved a draft Personal Data Protection Law and Oman has also drafted its data protection legislation. In the UAE, the Dubai Data Law regulates the dissemination and exchange of data in Dubai by government entities and affiliated organisations. There are also DIFC and AGDM regulations aimed at data protection, and various free zones and healthcare authorities that have data rules and codes of practice. 

Such rules and regulations offer varying data protection requirements, but there remains an absence of unifying, specialised, standalone federal data protection law for businesses and individuals, particularly when viewed against the voluminous regulations enacted in May 2018 in the European GDPR that replaced all data protection laws in all EU member states. 

The breadth and reach of GDPR beyond European borders reflect the scale of data in today’s world. Its recognition of the right to protection of personal data as a fundamental human right, its high standards of compliance and its sanctions for data breach, all combine to display a legislative recognition of the pivotal role of data in everyday life. 

Such seismic importance of data has also been recognised by European businesses. In February 2018, industrial giants Siemens, Airbus, Allianz, Daimler Group and IBM, together with the Munich Security Conference, NXP, SGS and Deutsche Telekom, signed a Charter of Trust on cyber security. The group’s aims include establishing binding regulations and standards on data security. The Charter invites dedicated governmental ministries to assume responsibility and the incorporation of cyber security /data protection regulations into free trade agreements; companies to implement chief information security officers, training and education; and the mandatory, independent third-party certification of critical digital networks. 

It appears to be merely a matter of time before such proposals materialise in Europe. It also appears to be inevitable that the UAE develops its existing legislative framework to implement a federal data protection law, presumably reflecting general European data protection principles. 

As interconnectivity and technology grow within the Fourth Industrial Revolution, so too will the sophistication of tools to hack and steal data. Alongside these layers of increased tension and risk, innovative cyber resilience products will develop and UAE data protection legislation will mature, presenting opportunities for growth within the cyber insurance industry.

Privacy issues,Dubai,"Digital security supplier InfoWatch has opened a cyber security training centre to focus on developing best practices, skills transfer and knowledge sharing to bridge a skills gap in the Middle East.

Cyber security company InfoWatch Group unveiled the Digital Technology and Cyber Security Training Centre in Dubai to instigate training by introducing knowledge sharing and skills transfer.

According to the supplier, the training hub will serve the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) market by equipping candidates that undergo the training with digital technology and cyber security skills. It said the Dubai training hub supports its commitment to enhance skills by bridging the skills gap in the MENA market through bespoke digital security training programmes.

The Dubai facility has been designed to replicate InfoWatch Groups flagship training hub in Moscow and is aimed at local government officials and business executives, students from field-specific universities and channel partners, the company stated.

Kristina Tantsyura, managing director, InfoWatch Group Middle East, said: Since our regional head office, we have strengthened our relations with existing clients in the Middle East including the Central Bank of Bahrain, Prime Ministers Court of Bahrain, First Energy Bank B.S.C. Bahrain, Venture Capital Bank (Bahrain), Kuwait Finance House, Petrochem UAE, and Haward Technology.

Moreover, we have been actively piloting our solutions for a number of new large customers.

Tantsyura added that: One of the most important achievements for us was the signing of the memorandum of understanding with the Ajman Digital Government and Ajman University on cooperation in information and cyber security and the development of joint digital security educational programmes.

For most enterprise organisations in the Middle East, the technical skills of some of their most valued workers pre-sales engineers, system designers, solutions architects, developers and customer support personnel can become obsolete in almost no time. And when they do become obsolete, so can the business.

One way organisations in the Middle East are sharpening their employees IT skills and maintaining their technology edge is by taking advantage of the training and certification opportunities offered by the IT suppliers.

Tantsyura said cyber security is a pressing issue for both businesses and government agencies worldwide, and in the Middle East market its not different, and thats why InfoWatch decided to open the Digital Technology and Cyber Security Training Centre to pay special attention to educational projects through customised training initiatives.

We have created a complete set of training programmes for clients of all sizes, she said.

She pointed out that apart from the training hub, InfoWatch has launched a new consulting practice in the Middle East market that is helping customers to perform data classification and develop information security policies tailored to their specific needs and requirements.

Tantsyura explained that the centre will enable customers big or small to educate their employees, from system administrators to information and cyber security executives. She said the company will on an ongoing basis engage IT security experts and professors from InfoWatchs partner universities that specialise in areas being most demanded at the moment, such as blockchain, data science, internet of things and artificial intelligence.

Privacy issues,Dubai,"If crimes are sophisticated, so are the preventive measures and awareness campaigns. From a Dh1 million fine to jail sentences, cyber criminals are heavily punished in the UAE. Police officials in Dubai and Abu Dhabi have also launched several platforms where people can register complaints online, and the Telecommunications Regulations Authority (TRA) is also conducting simultaneous awareness campaigns, especially for the younger generations.

For example, in May this year, the Dubai Police launched e-crime.ae, an online platform for members of the public to report cybercrimes. These include suspicious emails, social media related issues, internet calls, hacking, online bullying and cyber-extortion. Colonel Saeed Al Hajari, director of the Dubai Police Cybercrime Department, said there were a few simple steps involved in submitting a report.

""Users must first determine whether the complaint relates to cybercrime or an online service. They will then need to enter their Emirates ID and contact numbers, confirm their number via a text message, fill in some personal details, and then provide details of the complaint,"" he explained.

He said that the service will provide a ""true and effective measurement of cybercrime"", and the number of complaints filed by the public will increase on a new platform.

Awareness campaigns

According to a report on Wam, the Abu Dhabi Police have warned the public about fraud messages on social media applications, such as WhatsApp, which imitate trademarks and trusted websites. This is being done with the aim of stealing personal information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers and other information that may lead to problems for users, who are required to report these crimes to the police, to track and catch the criminals.

The Security Information Administration of the Commandship Affairs Sector stated that through information received by the 'Aman' service, they were able to track complex telephone fraud operations, where fraudsters were able to steal their victims' WhatsApp accounts. These accounts are then used for other cybercrimes, including offering fake raffle prizes. The administration urged social media users to secure their accounts, so they cannot be used by others in electronic crimes.

The Dubai Police are organising a cybercrime awareness campaign from September 1 to September 30 this year, according to information on the Dubai Police website. The campaign aims at increasing awareness of both young people and parents about cybercrimes, urging caution while sharing data and photographs on the Internet to avoid crimes such as blackmail and misuse of information.

Reach out to youngsters

In a bid to reach young people, the TRA recently launched the 'Emirates Cyber Ambassadors Initiative' as part of its information security awareness campaigns, which aims to train elite students in UAE schools to represent the team as ambassadors in promoting and spreading cybersecurity awareness across the UAE.

The initiative focuses on three focus areas - to provide safe e-culture training for selected 14 to 18-year-olds in selected schools; to improve presentation skills; and to raise awareness of best security practices among the public.

Mohammed Gheyath, executive director, Information Security Regulatory Affairs, said: ""In line with the UAE Vision 2021 on promoting a secure electronic lifestyle in the UAE, we began the pilot phase of the Cybersecurity Ambassadors Initiative in February of this year. Training workshops were offered to students to evaluate their performance and readiness to join the list of cybersecurity ambassadors. The results were promising, which led us to complement the revision and selection of 30 male students and 30 female students to represent the initiative.""

Privacy issues,Dubai,"A survey among healthcare professionals and healthcare users in Dubai has confirmed the public trust in e-health services systems offered in the UAE.

The survey titled 'Privacy Protection Laws And Public Perception Of Data Privacy: The Case Of Dubai E-Healthcare Services' also showed that the patients have not felt that the data privacy or security was compromised.

Though there is no adequate law or regulation to specifically address the issue of e-health medical privacy, service providers in Dubai are taking voluntary measures to protect the e-health data, according to the survey.

Carried out jointly by Jawahitha Sarabdeen, faculty of business, University of Wollongong, and Immanuel Azaad Moonesar from the Mohammed Bin Rashid School of Government, the recent survey was aimed at investigating the available e-health data privacy protection laws and the perception of the people using the e-healthcare facilities.

""The e-healthcare system brings many benefits with various challenges,"" said Dr Moonesar. ""The most significant problem is the protection of patients' data privacy.""

In the creation or use of e-healthcare, much health information about the patients is stored in the system of various medical service providers, professionals and insurance companies for record and reference purposes. Storing of sensitive information in the e-health system is unavoidable but could lead to misuse of information by unauthorised parties or for illegal purposes.

""Unless deliberate efforts are taken to secure these systems from design to implementation, most of the development achieved to date may not be adopted by many patients,"" read the survey.

The move toward e-healthcare in various countries is envisaged to reduce the cost of provision of healthcare, improve the quality of care and reduce medical errors.

The researchers also conducted a survey to collect the primary data of the residents of Dubai to understand their perception of the adoption e-health data protection.

""In Dubai, the health sector is one of the prioritised sectors, experiencing extraordinary growth. The healthcare industry is regulated by federal and state level regulation. The Dubai healthcare freezone - Dubai Health Care City and Dubai Biotechnology and Research Park - are governed by additional healthcare rules and regulations. There are a few laws that regulate the health sector in the UAE as a whole including Dubai,"" he said.

The respondents, who were identified as healthcare users, reported that the purpose of the last visit to the health care institution or clinic included emergency visits (17 per cent), medical follow-up (17 per cent), medical tests (20 per cent), and regular check-ups (40 per cent).

On the other hand, those respondents who were identified as healthcare professionals are doctors (three per cent), nurses (33 per cent), medical assistants (five per cent), dieticians and nutritionists (15 per cent), psychologists (10 per cent), and other health allied professionals (33 per cent).

In conclusion, the analysis of various laws and regulations reveals that the level of protection available for e-health service users is limited in application as they are only applied to the Dubai Health Care City. ""This would necessarily suggest that existing laws need to be amended, or else fresh legislation be made available to provide protection for the whole of Dubai,"" said Dr Moonesar.

""Since the current law on e-health data privacy is drafted after careful consideration of various countries laws on e-health, the provisions are similar to the existing laws in many developed countries.

Society and community,Abu Dhabi,"His Holiness Pope Francis and His Eminence the Grand Imam of Al Azhar Dr. Ahmed At-Tayyeb have signed the historic Abu Dhabi Declaration - a document on Human Fraternity in the United Arab Emirates.

The ""Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together"" seeks to encourage stronger relationships between people to promote coexistence among peoples and to confront extremism and its negative impacts.

The signing ceremony was in the presence of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai and His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces and attended by more than 400 religious leaders.

During the ceremony His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum also presented the first ""Human Fraternity Award - From Dar Zayed"" that was jointly given to Pope Francis and the Grand Imam.

The award was given to Dr. Ahmed at-Tayyeb in recognition of his firm position in defence of moderation, tolerance, global values and his vehement rejection of radical extremism.

Pope Francis meanwhile is well known as an advocate for tolerance and the laying aside of differences and for his determined call for the pursuit of peace and fraternity among humanity, and the award recognises this continued commitment and approach.

In a speech before signing the Abu Dhabi Declaration, Pope Francis said ""hatred and violence"" in the name of God cannot be justified, praising the value of education in reducing conflict.

Meanwhile Dr. Ahmed At-Tayyeb, who is one of the world's foremost Muslim leaders, called on Muslims to protect Christian communities in the Middle East and for Muslims in the West to integrate into their communities.

""You are part of this nation... You are not minorities,"" he said during his speech at the ceremony.

The ceremony was part of the broader Human Fraternity Meeting that has witnessed the first ever Papal visit to the Arabian Peninsula and hosted by the UAE Government.

Society and community,Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi: The foundation stone-laying ceremony of the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi will be held on April 20, according to the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Sanstha (BAPS) that is building the temple.

The ‘Shilanyas ceremony’ of the BAPS Hindu Mandir will be presided over by the spiritual leader of the BAPS, Mahant Swami Maharaj, confirmed the religious and social organisation within the Swaminarayan branch of Hinduism.

In a statement to Gulf News on Monday, BAPS said Maharaj will be making his first official visit to the UAE from April 18 to 29.

“He will preside over the Shilanyas Vidhi (foundation stone-laying ritual) on April 20 with members of the leadership of this nation. Aside from this, His Holiness will perform morning prayers every day [during] which all are welcome for darshan (viewing session for devotees). The exact location and time of these daily prayers are not yet finalised,” it said.

The announcement comes as the temple marks a year after the ground-breaking ceremony during which the first rites of Bhumi Pujan –sanctification of the land—were performed at the site in Abu Mureikhah area on February 11, 2018.

Witnessing the ceremony through a live stream at the Dubai Opera, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi had revealed a model structure of the temple with seven towers representing the seven emirates in the UAE.

Dubbed an icon of tolerance and religious harmony in the UAE, the temple is being built on 13.5 acres (55000 square metre) land gifted by His Highness Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, to the Indian community.

Additional land

In the Year of Tolerance, the UAE government has gifted an equal area of land additionally for building parking facilities in the temple premises, the priest in-charge of the BAPS Mandir said.

“The love and kindness shown by His Highness Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the UAE government cannot be expressed in words,” said Brahmavihari Swami.

“Time and time again, they have encouraged us and gone out of their way to aid us on this project. This time, to ensure the temple premises can serve the Hindu and the wider community effectively, they have graciously given an additional 13.5 acres of land for parking purposes,” he said in the statement to Gulf News.

He said the complex is going to be a special place which has been designed to be an architectural ode to the value of human harmony as espoused by the UAE and India.

The designs of the complex that is estimated to cost Dh450m are now being finalised and will be going through approval processes. The Mandir work in India is also progressing with pink stone from Rajasthan and marble from Macedonia scheduled to reach the sculpting sites in the coming months for the craftsmen to begin work. The Shilanyas ceremony in April will observe a sacred Hindu ritual wherein the first foundation stones are sanctified and fixed in the ground as the base of the Mandir. The Mandir’s foundation will then be made on these stones considered sacred. After these ceremonies, construction will begin in this Year of Tolerance, the BAPS said.

Privileges offered for temple ceremony

Abu Dhabi: The BAPS Mandir in Abu Dhabi is offering special privileges for attendees of the temple’s foundation stone-laying ceremony on April 20.

“On that historic day, yajmans will participate in a special ceremony. And those who wish to become yajmans can contact outreach@mandir.ae,” the BAPS said in a statement to Gulf News.

Yajmans or yajamanas are the ritual patrons, on whose behalf a religious ritual is performed by a priest.

“However, one and all are welcome from 2pm onwards to have darshan (viewing) of the foundation stones and also have a chance to sprinkle flowers as prayers for the temple,” the statement added.

On its website www.mandir.ae[http://www.mandir.ae] , the Mandir has stated that it will start online registration for the event on the site within the next week.

“We requested all devotees and well-wishers who wish to attend this historic festival to register on this website. This will allow us to serve our guests better.”

Registered visitors from abroad have also been offered special discounted rates on air tickets and hotel stay. “However, each visitor will be personally responsible for arranging all travel, sightseeing and accommodations for his/her visit,” the announcement added.

Society and community,Abu Dhabi,"Pope Francis returned on Tuesday from a historic visit to the United Arab Emirates - the first-ever visit of a pope to the Arabian peninsula, where Islam was founded in the seventh century. It is one of the worst places on the planet to be a Christian.

The U.A.E. trip was hopeful and welcome, but also highlighted how fraught the situation of Christians in the Muslim world actually is.

The Pope signed a joint declaration of ""human fraternity"" with Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar in Cairo, the leading university in the Sunni world. While Islam does not have a central authority like the pope, Al-Azhar has sufficient history and prestige that its positions can be considered a leading institutional voice.

Pope Francis and Egypt's Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb greet each other as they exchange documents during the Human Fraternity meeting in Abu Dhabi on Feb. 4, 2019.

The declaration was the kind of windy document produced at international gatherings, full of noble ideals and soaring rhetoric. But it also included a specific condemnation of violence in the name of religion.

""We resolutely declare that religions must never incite war, hateful attitudes, hostility and extremism, nor must they incite violence or the shedding of blood,"" the joint declaration reads.

The declaration concluded an interfaith meeting on fraternity hosted in Abu Dhabi, which brought together some 700 religious leaders - Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and others - to work toward greater tolerance and understanding.

The Emirates played host because such a gathering would be illegal in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, and impossible to hold safely in, for example, Pakistan. Yet while good manners led Pope Francis to extol the U.A.E. as a land of ""tolerance"" and ""coexistence,"" the very fact the U.A.E. is considered praiseworthy indicates how bleak the situation for religious minorities is across the Islamic world.

Last year, the U.A.E. ranked 45th among the world's top 50 nations regarding religious freedom according to Open Doors, a Protestant watchdog group that tracks anti-Christian persecution around the world. In the U.A.E., Christians are able to worship - sometimes in churches built by the Emirati government itself for its foreign worker population - but religious liberty does not exist in a fulsome way. But the bar is set so low for Muslim countries that the U.A.E. is hailed as a beacon of tolerance.

Easily impressed journalists covering the papal trip breathlessly reported that to honour the visit of Pope Francis and the Grand Imam, a new church and mosque are to be built in Abu Dhabi. The mosque will be named after the Grand Imam himself, the church after St. Francis, the Holy Father's patron saint.

While the church and mosque side-by-side can be presented as a model of co-operation, more often the reality is one of harassment. Twenty years ago I spent Christmas in the U.A.E., visiting the Catholic churches in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi. They had been built with government patronage and goodwill, separated by some distance from local mosques, so as to avoid provocation.

In short order, local Muslims built mosques immediately next door, from which the amplified call-to-prayer can be blasted at the churches to disrupt services. Rather naive, I wondered how it was that the muezzin seemed not to follow the usual schedule, but hit maximum volume just when the Catholic liturgy was underway. Nobody there had to ask why.

Pope Francis arrives in the popemobile to lead the first-ever papal mass in the Arabian peninsula, at the Zayed Sports City Stadium in Abu Dhabi, on Feb. 5, 2019.

But in the U.A.E. it is not illegal to be a Christian, as it is next door in Saudi Arabia. Christians are not violently expelled from their homes, as in Iraq and Syria. Christians do not risk being massacred as they gather for Christmas, as in Egypt. Christians are not arrested and sentenced to death for ""blasphemy,"" as in Pakistan. The religious sisters of Mother Teresa, who care for the poorest of the poor, are not murdered, as they were in Yemen in 1998 and 2016.

There are not jihadist terror groups that bomb churches, killing people at prayer, as happened last week in the Muslim part of the Philippines.

Unlike nearby Qatar, which permitted the first Catholic Church only in 2008, Catholics have had churches in the U.A.E. since the 1960s. So if a pope was to come to Arabia, it had to be the U.A.E., which is only praiseworthy in comparison to greater outrages nearby.

The good words of the joint declaration have been said before to no great effect, but it does not hurt to say them again. The Emirati gave Pope Francis a genuinely warm welcome, which is no small thing. In turn, the Holy Father pretended not to notice the petroleum-fuelled obscene luxury which is the raison d'être of the U.A.E.; there is no less friendly place for climate-change measures or migrants than Arabia, to mention just two of the pope's priorities.

The Christians in the Emirates are not free. They are just not in mortal danger.

The 'Global Conference of Human Fraternity' opened with a welcome from HE Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, the UAE's Minister of Tolerance, to an event that ""encourages compassion, respect and understanding among different communities, cultures and religions"", and a call to ""counter extremism, prejudice, hate, aggression, greed, and oppression that violate the very idea of human fraternity.""

Taking place under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, the conference is convened by the Muslim Council of Elders, an Abu Dhabi-based independent international organisation headed by His Eminence the Grand Imam of Al Azhar Al Sharif, Dr Ahmed El-Tayeb, to discuss the encouragement of fraternity as a core human value.

Dr Sultan Faisal Al Remeithi, Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Elders, said: ""This distinguished forum in Abu Dhabi reflects the important cultural and humanitarian role that the UAE plays in promoting a global culture of peace and reinforcing the key concept of citizenship while remaining respectful of diversity and tolerance of different faiths.""

The conference is being held in conjunction with the inaugural visit of His Holiness Pope Francis, Head of the Catholic Church and Sovereign of the Vatican City State to the UAE. Under the theme ""Make me a Channel of Your Peace"", Pope Francis's visit - the first of its kind to the Arab Gulf region - represents a call for global fraternal collaboration based on peaceful dialogue and cooperation, mutual tolerance, and a rejection of extremism and violence.

Highlights of the day included two sessions devoted to exploring ""Principles of Human Fraternity"" and ""Common Responsibility for Achieving Human Fraternity"" through insights from senior government, religious and intellectual leaders on the critical importance of promoting fraternity, tolerance and citizenship awareness as ways of preventing extremism and conflict.

The first session, chaired by Her Excellency Noura bint Mohammed Al Kaabi, UAE Minister of Culture and Knowledge Development, featured an all-female panel of experts discussing the role of women in achieving productive cooperation filled with trust, respect, and love. The second session featured a call by Rabbi Michael Schudrich, Chief Rabbi of Poland, for mutual tolerance based on every individual's understanding of how others may see things differently, including everyone's path to God.

Both sessions were framed by intensive workshops on tolerance, humanity and coexistence, which discussed ways in which fraternity could be reinforced and spread as a global value. Among the many topics discussed at these workshops was the need for peaceful coexistence as every man, woman and child wants access to peace, justice, dignity, cooperation and most importantly love as shared traits among humankind. Delegates also stressed the practice of human fraternity as a foundation for collaboration across different nationalities and religions.

Society and community,Abu Dhabi,"On the peninsula of the Arabs, two religions shall not coexist."" So runs a saying traditionally attributed to Omar ibn al-Khattab, one of the Prophet Muhammad's closest companions and Islam's second caliph. Omar's commandment, and others like it, have justified the Muslim faith's exclusive supremacy on the peninsula for more than 1,400 years.

Well, so much for that.

On Sunday, Pope Francis became the first ever Catholic pontiff to visit Abu Dhabi, the glittering capital of the United Arab Emirates. In our social-media age, with its endless parade of fleeting images, it's easy to overlook the significance of this: The vicar of Christ has arrived in Islam's birthplace - sandy terrain from which Muslims once violently extirpated rival religions.

More than that, Francis is here to celebrate the Mass, the ancient Christian liturgy in which the creator of the universe makes himself mysteriously present under the appearance of bread and wine, per Catholic belief. ""For where two or three gather in my name,"" Jesus told his followers, ""there am I in the midst of them."" The papal Mass here drew 120,000 faithful.

The invitation to the Holy Father solidifies the UAE's status as the most responsible power in the Persian Gulf region. And it gives testament to the Emirati leadership's determination to transcend the bloody, cruel fanaticism that has disfigured the House of Islam and brought ruin to Christians and other minorities unfortunate enough to dwell inside it.

The Emirates' openness is palpable when you visit the Dubai Mall, where vastly different modes of life - local women with veiled faces, Eastern European tourists with plunging necklines and perilously short skirts, manbun-sporting Arab hipsters and kippah-wearing Orthodox Jews - overlap in safety and peace.

That same civilizational confidence is apparent at the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, the ginormous, Aladdin-style edifice devoted to glorifying Allah - as well as the Emirates' visionary founder, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan. Where else in the Muslim world can you find a mosque that makes a point of putting interfaith outreach at the forefront of its activities? Or a mosque festooned with pictures of the pope and other Christian leaders?

A reform vision defines the UAE's geopolitical posture, as well. Threatened by the expansionist Tehran regime, Abu Dhabi (along with Riyadh) has forged a strategic partnership with Jerusalem that is the region's worst-kept secret. But in the UAE's case, the ties go beyond the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Since 2010, three Israeli cabinet ministers have visited the UAE to discuss infrastructure, energy and sports.

As Zaki Nusseibeh, a minister of state and adviser to the late Sheikh Zayed, told me: ""There is no enmity between us and the state of Israel.""

Opinion polling suggests that the UAE leadership's enlightened attitudes have begun to filter down to the populace. A YouGov survey conducted ahead of the pope's visit found that Emiratis are much less likely to be concerned if a close relative marries a Christian than their neighbors in Saudi Arabia and Egypt would be. And while only about a third of Egyptians and Saudis expressed fears about Islamic extremism, more than half of Emiratis did.

YouGov concluded: ""UAE results overall are often nearer to that of Western samples than to fellow"" Mideast nations ""when it comes to general attitudes to world religions.""

Yes, UAE openness befits a federation of commercial city-states, but Westerners tempted to sneer should ask themselves: Which is preferable, the joyful materialism of nouveaux riches Emiratis - or the extremism of the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State, Hezbollah, Hamas and other groups of the kind? Which is better for Christians and other regional minorities, not to mention Arabs themselves?

And true, the country isn't any sort of liberal democracy. Virtually all UAE Muslims, for example, hear the same sermon at Friday prayers - one drafted by a government-approved committee charged with countering radicalism. That goes against every liberal instinct in the West's bones, but if it means fewer ISIS atrocities here or in our homelands, I'll take it. The common good isn't always and everywhere served by our form of government.

That's an idea the Catholic Church understands deeply, having endured all sorts of powers and principalities for two millennia. Western NGOs and reporters who expect Francis to fulminate against this or that injustice while he's here forget that the pope brings the deepest reform message of all: the good news of Jesus Christ.

According to news reporting out of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""Inspired by the social and economic benefits of diversity, we analyze over 9 million papers and 6 million scientists to study the relationship between research impact and five classes of diversity: ethnicity, discipline, gender, affiliation, and academic age. Using randomized baseline models, we establish the presence of homophily in ethnicity, gender and affiliation.""

Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Department of Computer Science, ""We then study the effect of diversity on scientific impact, as reflected in citations. Remarkably, of the classes considered, ethnic diversity had the strongest correlation with scientific impact. To further isolate the effects of ethnic diversity, we used randomized baseline models and again found a clear link between diversity and impact. To further support these findings, we use coarsened exact matching to compare the scientific impact of ethnically diverse papers and scientists with closely-matched control groups.""

According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""Here, we find that ethnic diversity resulted in an impact gain of 10.63% for papers, and 47.67% for scientists.""

Society and community,Abu Dhabi,"by Muhammad Aamir ABU DHABI, 12th November, 2018 (WAM) -- Religious leaders at the 'Wilton Park Inclusive Citizenship Dialogues' on Monday underlined the importance of promoting 'inclusive citizenship' through dialogue for better religious harmony and understanding among different religions, as part of the Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies.

The three-day Forum, which opened today at the Saadiyat Rotana Resort and Villas, Saadiyat Island, brought together prominent Muslim, Christian and other religious scholars from the Middle East, along with a number of policy makers, with the aim of developing a common interfaith understanding and definition of inclusive citizenship in the Middle East as well as exploring how this might be implemented to help tackle exclusion and discrimination and address the root causes of violent extremism.

Two further dialogue sessions will be held next year to enable the delivery of legislative and practical change to promote inclusive citizenship across the region.

The dialogue session held today was hosted by Wilton Park, an Executive Agency of the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office and by the Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies, based in Abu Dhabi, and in partnership with the Rashad Centre for Cultural Governance of Adyan Foundation, based in Lebanon.

Opening speakers included Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon, the UK Prime Minister’s Special Envoy on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Sheikh Dr. Mohammed bin Abdul Karim al-Issa, Secretary-General of the Muslim World League and Souraya Bechealany, Secretary-General of the Middle East Council of Churches.

The President of the Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies and Chairman of the Fatwa Council of the UAE, Sheikh Abdullah bin Bayyah, in his opening speech introduced the Marrakesh Declaration to Forum participants, its components and the principles that serve as a framework on citizenship.

""Through these conventions, we envisage to emerge with a fully rooted and completely grounded conceptualisation of inclusive citizenship, which is derived from religious texts and which keeps abreast of the contemporary cultural context as exemplified in national constitutions and international covenants and charters,"" he said referring to the 2016 Marrakesh Declaration, on protecting the rights of religious minorities in majority Muslim nations.

""We will also identify and diagnose the obstacles and challenges to the realisation of this inclusive concept of citizenship and the impediments it faces in the countries of the Middle East,"" Sheikh Bayyah added.

The Declaration serves to reflect the Islamic values and the methodological foundations underlying the obligation of joyful and happy coexistence and good and kind treatment of adherents of other faiths and religious traditions, he added.

He sited an example where in 1995, the British Government banned the screening of the film ""Visions of Ecstasy"", because it considered it as blasphemous, slanderous and offensive to Prophet Isa (may Allah’s peace be upon him), which the courts of the United Kingdom confirmed and reiterated. In response the director of the film filed a suit before the European Court of Human Rights by regarding the ban imposed by the British government as being contrary to the freedom of expression and the right to publish opinions.

After the court heard the case, it supported the British government's position that the film was blasphemous and transgressed the limits permitted for dealing with a sacred subject in accordance with British law at the time.

In a similar case, he said, the European Court affirmed in mid-October the soundness of the verdicts of the Austrian judiciary in the case of insulting the Prophet Muhammad, PBUH, furnishing as justification for this decision (numbered 2018/360) that abusive and offensive claims cannot fall within the scope of freedom of expression, as they infringe on the rights of other citizens in having their religious beliefs respected and threaten religious peace in Austrian society.

""We can only appreciate these decisions as they contribute to the promotion of world peace and to the spread of love and tolerance in the world. They certainly represent rational judicial and legal precedents (case law) that the courts of the West will have to take into account in this type of cases,"" he said.

Likewise what should be noted is the UAE's policy of consolidating the principles of citizenship which is marked by being realistic in taking into account the specificity of the local context and by clarity of purpose, he affirmed. ""This is clearly reflected in its enactment of Federal Law No. 02 of 2015, which deals with combating discrimination, hate speech and showing contempt for religions, and works to immunise the society and protect it from hate speech and incitement to violence and disturbing the tranquility, calmness and social peace.""Sheikh Dr. Mohammed Al Issa presented a roadmap to achieve the goal of inclusive citizenship including: reinforcing scholastic curricula, government and private support for activities aimed at promoting the values of citizenship and integration, discouraging hatred and exclusion, prevention of religious, cultural or ethnic isolation in the education or social activities, and the role of civil society organisations in raising awareness about legislative provisions.

He also said that we should prevent any method that would lead to discrimination on the basis of religion or race, be it a legislative, employment or political or media action. Al Issa went on to say that it is incumbent on all national, political and other events to stand in the way of any slogan calling for hatred. He said that religious and ethic minorities must engage their own affairs without outside interference that aim at handling and running their activities instead. He also said that harsh social conditions of some minorities must be addressed, since some of their members harbour reactions saturated with hatred or despair.

Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon, UK Prime Minister’s Special Envoy on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Minister of State for the Commonwealth and the UN, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London in his speech lauded UAE for playing a leading role in the region in promoting tolerance as a way of countering some of the root causes of extremism. He stressed the importance of the faith leaders by not just taking a moral leadership role, and preaching compassion, mutual respect and peace within our respective communities but also importantly encouraging reading of scriptures that promote the values of tolerance.

Other speakers included Dr Abdullah Almatouq, Advisor to the Emir’s Court of Kuwait; Dr Farid El Khazen, Ambassador, Embassy of Lebanon in Vatican, Holy See, Rome; Bishop Yousif Thomas Mirkis Archbishop of Kirkuk and Sulaymaniyah, Chaldean Church, Kirkuk; Faisal bin Muaammar, Secretary-General, KAICIID Dialogue Centre, Vienna; Dr Souraya Bechealany, Secretary-General, Middle East Council of Churches, Beirut and Shaykh Usama al-Sayyid al-Azhari, Religious Advisor to the President of Egypt, Cairo.

The opening was attended by Dr Mohammed Matar Salem bin Abid Al Kaabi, Chairman of the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments, UAE and Secretary-General of the Forum for Peace in Muslim Societies, members of the diplomatic corps, academics, scholars and religious leaders.

Society and community,Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, Apr 17 2018 (WAM) – Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al-Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, delivered a ministerial address at the Green Business Summit 2018, underlining the numerous sustainability initiatives and environmental programmes being developed and implemented in the UAE. He emphasised that the UAE is well aware of the future impact of climate change and is firmly committed to the Paris Agreement. He said that last year the UAE launched its National Climate Change Plan, at the heart of which is the target of generating 27 percent of the country's energy from clean sources by 2021, and 50 percent by 2050.

The minister also stressed the pivotal role played by the private sector in this transition and how the UAE government is advancing public-private partnerships across numerous sectors to incentivise sustainable practices and support green innovation. He went on to offer a few examples of sustainable initiatives taking place in the UAE, such as DP World's launch of the Middle East's largest solar rooftop project.

The Green Business Summit 2018 opened in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday with a keynote address by Charles Goddard, The Economist Intelligence Unit's Asia-Pacific Editorial Director, who welcomed attendees and highlighted the significant opportunities and challenges faced by business leaders, policymakers, and investors as nations around the world strive to adopt sustainable development practices.

Organised by The Economist Events, part of the global English-language weekly newspaper, the first-of-its-kind summit took place at the Rosewood Hotel, Abu Dhabi.

Speaking at the conference, Goddard said, “Sustainability and green business are the defining issues, the defining themes of our time. It has been roughly two years since the Paris Agreement when the world agreed to cap global emissions to limit climate change and global warming, and it has been two and a half years since the Sustainable Development Goals were ratified by the United Nations. These are rightly seen as seminal moments, a sea-change in our thinking on societies and development. Today we will be asking, how much progress has been made?”

Speaking on the subject of green business, he added, “On the important transition of business, there has been some gathering progress in terms of sustainability. Corporate commitments have been made and are beginning to be met. However, despite these positive developments, progress remains fragmented and quite piece-meal. The task ahead is quite daunting.”

Speaking during the first business panel of the day, titled “From responsibility to leadership,” Razan Khalifa Al Mubarak, Secretary-General of the Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi, EAD, said, “I think we can do more with the private sector, which is why I am here today; it gives us at the Environment Agency a chance to better understand the needs and challenges faced by businesses.”

Commenting on the evolving role of EAD, she added, “It is one thing when government agencies are the only ones responsible for safeguarding the environment, and it is another thing when the private sector shares responsibility for monitoring its impact. Sharing the task of protecting the environment with the private sector increases awareness and understanding of environmental regulation and leads to better outcomes and a cleaner, safer environment for us all this is one of the many ways we can move the needle from compliance to beyond compliance and towards innovation. At the heart of this transition are public-private partnerships, which enable continuous improvement and kick-start innovation.”

Discussing the occasional tension between businesses and environmental protection, Khaleefa Salem Al Mansouri, Under-Secretary of Abu Dhabi's Department of Economic Development, DED, said, “Sometimes there is a clash between business objectives and maintaining and respecting the environment. However, over the past ten years, we have focused on achieving our economic objectives while at the same time protecting the environment. It is always a challenge, but we are working to find the right formula for businesses and industries to grow while mitigating their impact on the environment.”

Siim Kiisler, Estonia's Minister of Environment, and Khaled Mohamed Fahmy Abdel Aal, Egypt's Minister of Environment, hosted a panel discussion on the politics of change. They discussed how policymakers can cultivate sustainable practices through regulatory frameworks and partnerships with the private sector that encourage environmental innovation

Society and community,Abu Dhabi,"UNHCR's Zakat initiative is fully Sharia compliant and is backed by five fatwas from leading Islamic scholars and institutions and is subject to rigorous governance, ensuring transparency at every step, from donation to provision of assistance. UNHCR has adopted a digital only approach to paying Zakat, ensuring security, efficiency, transparency and complete peace of mind. The new platform can be accessed at zakat.unhcr.org[https://zakat.unhcr.org] 

Houssam Chahine, Head of Private Sector Partnerships for UNHCR in the MENA region said: ""The situation of refugees globally is one of the biggest human tragedies of our time, with more than 22.5 million refugees, 40% of which are in the MENA region. Since Muslims make up the majority of today's refugee populations, the Zakat initiative comes timely to secure life-saving humanitarian assistance to refugees in need.""

""UNHCR ensures 100% of Zakat contributions go directly to eligible refugees under the extreme poverty line, with no money taken off for overheads. The new global platform makes fulfilling Zakat obligations fast and simple for those wishing to help refugee families with their Zakat, until these families become self-reliant."" Chahine added.

Noureddin Harthi, CEO of Tabah Foundation, said: ""Our co-operation with UNHCR over the Zakat initiative is built on our two organisations' shared values and our mission to help humanity. Through this partnership, we provide UNHCR with technical expertise and knowledge that ensure the transparency and sustainability of this commendable Zakat initiative."" Harthi added, ""there are many refugee families in need in the region, and the Zakat initiative comes as a lifeline for the most vulnerable of them.""

UNHCR implements a wide range of humanitarian assistance programmes including provision of shelter, healthcare, education, and cash assistance - the latter has been identified as the best fit for Zakat funds. The programme provides direct financial aid to more than 60,000 refugee families below the extreme poverty line in Jordan and Lebanon, allowing them to take back some control of their circumstances while contributing to the local economy.

Recipients of cash assistance are vetted by UNHCR, while the provision of aid under the Zakat initiative is implemented by UNHCR and evaluated by representatives from Tabah to ensure strong governance and full compliance. In addition, quarterly reports on how Zakat funds are distributed are posted on UNHCR's Zakat website. UNHCR is considering Zakat for other eligible refugees and IDPs, and will add them to the platform once compliance and necessary processes are finalized.

UNHCR reports shows that in Jordan, the bulk of cash assistance is spent on rent, food, healthcare and debt repayments, while in Lebanon, families prioritise food, healthcare, utility bills and transportation. In Jordan, $2,160 provides 12 families with enough cash to cover rent, food, healthcare and debt repayment for 1 month, while in Lebanon, $2,100 provides 12 families with enough cash to cover food, rent, healthcare, and utility bills for 1 month.

UNHCR has a 68-year track record in assisting refugees in need throughout the world, regardless of the background of their plight. Through its Zakat initiative, UNHCR is the first major agency of its type to provide an efficient, trusted route for people to fulfil Zakat obligations.

The scholars and institutions that have issued fatwas supporting the UNHCR Zakat initiative are:  Dr Sheikh Ali Gomaa, former Grand Mufti of Egypt and professor of Islamic jurisprudence at Al-Azhar University; Sheikh Abdullah bin Bayyah of King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah; the Fatwa Council of Tarim, Hadramaut Yemen, the Senior Scholars' Council of Morocco; and Dar al-Ifta al-Missriyah, one of Egypt's leading centers for Islamic legal research.

Society and community,Dubai,"Dubai/Abu Dhabi: A Dubai conference this weekend will see the launch of a dividend-cum-pension scheme for expatriates from the South Indian State of Kerala and deliberations to set up institutions to support them, the state’s Chief Minister told Gulf News on Tuesday.

In an interview ahead of his four-day UAE visit that begins on Wednesday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan confirmed that he would launch the lifelong monthly dividend-cum-pension scheme based on a one-time deposit at the first Middle East Regional Conference of the Loka Kerala Sabha (LKS) or World Kerala Assembly, which will be held in Dubai’s Etisalat Academy on Friday and Saturday.

LKS is a global platform constituted by the government for more than 3.5 million Non-Resident Keralites (NRKs) across the world. Of the 200-strong LKS members from across the globe attending the summit, 25 will represent an estimated one million Keralites in the UAE, the largest expatriate community in the country.

Vijayan said the NRKs can invest Rs500,000 (Dh25,952) minimum or its multiples in the new scheme.

“On completion of five years, depositor or his/her legal heir will get a monthly income. The deposits will be invested in Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) or similar financial agencies. The interest from KIIFB will be given as dividends,” he explained.

As Gulf News reported on October 30, 2018, the scheme will be able to ensure a high return (possibly around 12 per cent) as the deposit will be locked in during the lifetime of the depositor and his or her spouse, the most probable nominee. This means the government gets the deposit for a long time — probably 20 to 40 years to utilise it for development projects through KIIFB that facilitates development of both physical and social infrastructure in the state.

The chief minister pointed out that a government body is giving a monthly pension of Rs2,000 (Dh103.80) to NRKs returning from abroad after their employment.

“It is the present government that assumed office in 2016 enhanced the pension to Rs2,000 from Rs500. It was a gesture towards NRKs’ contribution. However, we can’t say it is an adequate scheme,” he said.

Vijayan and top officials of the state government will attend the two-day conference in Dubai’s Etisalat Academy on Friday and Saturday. He will address a public event of around 15,000 Keralites on Friday evening.

New entities planned

The chief minister said the conference would discuss other welfare measures for NRKs and the establishment of important institutions to support the state’s development with their support.

The Kerala Government has shortlisted 10 proposals that include, setting up an investment company, cooperatives, construction company and an International Migration Centre for promoting migration studies.

The chief minister said the details of the proposed institutions and remaining six proposals would be revealed after the discussions at the conference.

“We will take a final view after the deliberations at the LKS.”

He said the ten proposals were shortlisted from 48 recommendations received from seven standing committees of LKS, which deals with seven different topics for the state’s development and NRKs’ welfare. These seven committees were constituted in the first conference of the LKS held in January 2018 in Kerala.

“As you know LKS is a unique venture to provide a common platform for Keralites living across the world for productive interaction among themselves and with the state government. I believe LKS would ensure participation of NRKs, who have been contributing hugely in numerous ways for the development of Kerala,” he said.

Vijayan said the LKS has a permanent secretariat to guide and monitor its functions. “Our experience is that all the respective committees are functioning well. The LKS has instilled confidence among NRKs as they have now a say in the matters relating to their state,” he said.

Highlights of the Dubai conference

Conference will discuss 10 proposals including setting up of four important institutions for NRKs such as investment company, cooperatives, construction company and an International Migration Centre for promoting migration studies.

Society and community,Dubai,"An Emirati woman who fled to the Republic of Macedonia has made a desperate plea for help after her asylum request was rejected by the Balkan state.

In a video posted online and obtained by CNN, Hind Mohammad Albolooki, 42, says she fled Dubai after her family threatened her when she sought a divorce from her husband.

Her request for asylum in Macedonia was rejected on February 4 by the Macedonia interior ministry. While awaiting a decision, Albolooki is being held in immigration detention, where she has been since December 7, and now fears she will be deported back to the United Arab Emirates.

In a video recorded in December before her arrest, Albolooki said her family did not approve of her seeking a divorce because it would affect their reputation.

""They don't want their name to be spoiled,"" she said.

Albolooki said her family tried to take her passport away.

""If someone is asking for passport or ID, that means that there is something going on and I wasn't that stupid,"" Albolooki said, adding that in that moment she decided to run away.

""I am a mother of four children. No mother would leave her kids just like this,"" she said. ""But I had to leave my kids. I had no other choice.""

Escaping Dubai via Turkey and Serbia

Albolooki's friend Nenad Dimitrov, who lives in Kochani, Macedonia, and has been running the 42-year-old's Twitter account[https://twitter.com/HAlbolooki] since she was detained, said he met her on a cruise ship and has been in contact with her since.

He said Albolooki escaped her family on October 2 after being allowed to go to the toilet. From there, he said, she ran -- without her shoes -- and hid in a nearby construction area before finally hailing a taxi that took her to a friend's place in the Emirati city of Sharjah. He said from there she fled overland to Bahrain.

CNN has been unable to contact Albolooki's family.

Dimitrov said Albolooki reached out to him asking to help her book flights to Macedonia because she was afraid to book them on her credit card.

""When she asked for help she was in Bahrain and said 'I don't have anyone to go to, can you help me get tickets?'"" Dimitrov told CNN.

Albolooki eventually flew through Turkey to Serbia before entering Macedonia on October 4. She applied for asylum two weeks later.

In a statement, Macedonia's interior ministry said Albolooki's asylum request was denied in February because there ""was no evidence of persecution ... on the grounds of her race, religion, nationality ... or political affiliation.""

It added that there was ""no reason to believe that, should she return (to Dubai), she would be faced with a real risk of serious injury.""

It said it had since granted Albolooki a 15-day grace period to voluntarily leave the country. Dimitrov said Albolooki is eager to seek asylum elsewhere, but detention has made that difficult.

Albolooki is 'likely to be severely punished' if she returns

Radha Stirling from the UK-based advocacy group Detained in Dubai[https://www.detainedindubai.org/] said if Albolooki returned to the UAE she would ""likely be severely punished for her escape.""

""The patriarchal system, and informal male guardianship rules she is fleeing are just as pronounced in the UAE as they are in Saudi Arabia,"" Stirling said.

""There is a misconception that the Emirates is a more liberal, Westernized society; the UAE has worked very hard to manufacture that image, but the reality is drastically different.

""We have seen rape victims arrested and charged with having sex outside marriage, women denied custodial access to their children after divorce, and the laws actually stipulate the necessity of female obedience to a male guardian.""

Stirling suggested Macedonia rushed to deny Albolooki asylum because of the ""soft power wielded by the UAE in less wealthy nations through the use of investment.""

According to the nongovernmental organization Transparency International, Macedonia was ranked 34 out of 100 for its perceived levels of public sector corruption in 2017[https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017].

Relations between the UAE and Macedonia are handled in Rome.

In a statement released by WAM, the official news agency of the UAE, the deputy head of mission at the UAE Embassy in Rome, Ahmed Almulla, said his government was aware of Albolooki's social media posts.

""The embassy will collect any evidence of illegal threats made against her and pass it to police so that it can be fully investigated. Our embassy staff are ready to help Mrs. Albolooki in any way they can,"" Almulla said.

""Domestic abuse is a serious crime, and has no place whatsoever in the UAE; Emirati women are protected and fully empowered under UAE laws. Crimes involving harm against women are severely prosecuted under UAE law, and these allegations should and will be fully investigated.""

Albolooki's story comes after the Dubai ruler's daughter, Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum, made headlines last year for reportedly trying to escape her family[https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/24/middleeast/dubai-princess-sheika-latifa-photos-intl/index.html] after claiming she was tortured and detained for three years.

Society and community,Dubai,"Dubai, Feb 12 (PTI) Food security is the most important issue as no city or country in the world is completely food secure in view of climate change, population growth, increased urbanisation, changing dietary patterns and decreased arable land, according to a report released here.

According to the Oliver Wyman report titled 'Sustainable and Resilient Foods for Future Generation' launched at the World Government summit here all these factors play a significant role in disrupting the food supply chain and availability.

The report offers governments around the world the framework to assess the state of their food security and the tools to strengthen it both from regulatory and technological standpoints.

The report emphasised that there is no ""one size fits all"" solution, but highlighted lessons learnt and identified best practices that can be implemented to avert a food crisis.

Although efforts have been made, nothing can be done without increased investment in the agriculture sector and enabling technology transfer towards places with agricultural potential that lack the means to develop it.

Food security must be developed in all aspects if it is to exist at all, with countries and cities following a holistic approach when considering their food systems from ‘farm-to-fork’ and the interconnection of their national systems to the world.

""Our findings suggest that no city or country in the world is completely food secure. All cities from New York to Dubai face their own variant of food challenges and must develop their own way to address them. There is no unique solution to this challenge, but our food system model must be redefined from production to consumption factoring in issues of waste and loss,” said Mathieu De Clercq, Partner, Public Sector, Oliver Wyman.

""To build a resilient agriculture and food system, cities must undertake an audit centralised around the five dimensions of food security- availability, physical access, economic access, utilisation and their stability over time. We have examined five cities: New York, Singapore, Riyadh, Dubai and Havana to assess how secure they are along these five dimensions,"" he added.

The report puts forward a series of regulatory initiatives combined to technological recommendations to address weak links and comprehensively ensure that their population’s most basic needs are fully met, now and for the future generation.

With the technological revolution now rife across the globe, cities especially in the Gulf region have the financial means are encouraged to invest in technologies such as vertical farming or greenhouses to increase output.

Food security is also ensured through investments in climate smart technologies and infrastructures. PTI CORR PMS

Society and community,Dubai,"Feb. 11 -- Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of UAE issued the following news release:

In the presence of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, delivered a keynote speech at the 7th World Government Summit, which started today in Dubai.

Also present were H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, H.H. Lt. General Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, and H.H. Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Presidential Affairs.

Sheikh Abdullah said the visit made by His Holiness Pope Francis, Head of the Catholic Church, and Dr Ahmed el-Tayeb, Grand Imam of Al Azhar, to the UAE and their signing of the 'Document of Human Fraternity, helped open a new page in the history of religious dialogue.

""Pope Francis and Dr. el-Tayeb's journey of peace started years ago. They sat together as brothers and friends to tell the world that peace is difficult to achieve, but it is not impossible,"" he said.

Sheikh Abdullah referred to the papal mass held by Pope Francis in Abu Dhabi which was attended by over 180,000 faithful.

""It was a pleasant scene to see them filled with joy as they greet His Holiness the Pope. It was a message from the UAE to all residents that as a government and people, we are committed, not only to provide care and decent living standards to them but also to provide means to them to practice their faith.""

He also hailed the launching of the Human Fraternity Award - Dar Zayed, by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, which was jointly bestowed on Pope Francis and the Grand Imam.

Society and community,Dubai,"While both cities consume minimal amounts of domestically produced food, the strong economies of Riyadh and Dubai allow both cities to be food secure, according to a new report on food security from international management consultancy Oliver Wyman.

According to the report, which was launched at the World Government Summit in Dubai, Riyadh - with a population of over 6.9 million - suffers from a heavy reliance on imports, limited local production and increasing consumption.

Combined, the report noted that these factors pose a significant risk to the city’s food security, particularly in time of low oil prices. Additionally, Saudi Arabia as a whole has the highest rate of food waste globally, with lifestyle changes and Western-style diets causing growing obesity issues.

On the other hand, the report noted that oil revenue and subsidy programmes enable to country to meet all its food production requirements.”

In nearby Dubai, which has a population of approximately 2.7 million, the report said the emirate benefits from significant transport and logistical infrastructure, high income-per capita, low tariffs and barriers to trade, economic stability and inexpensive energy supply.

However, the report added that although Dubai has diversified its import partners over the past years, it will have to go further to offset its lack of significant domestic production.”

The report said that while the UAE as a whole imports between 80 and 90 percent of its food supplies, it is considered food secure due to its capacity to purchase food on the international market even if at higher costs.”

Food consumption in the UAE is growing due to the influx of tourists and to overall population growth,” it added.

In a statement, Oliver Wyman said that food security is the most important issue of our time” and emphasised that there exists no ‘one size fits all solution’.

Our findings suggest that no city or country in the world is completely food secure,” said Mathieu de Clercq, partner, public sector, Oliver Wyman. All cities from New York to Dubai face their own variant of food challenges and must develop their own way to address them.

There is no unique solution to this challenge, but our food system model must be redefined from production to consumption factoring in issues of waste and loss,” he added.

Society and community,Dubai,"At 32, Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum went nowhere without a watchful chauffeur.

“There’s no justice here,” she said in a video she secretly recorded[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN7OEFyNUkQ] last year. “Especially if you’re a female, your life is so disposable.”

So it was with a jolt of astonishment that her friends overseas read a WhatsApp message from her last March announcing that she had left Dubai “for good.”

“Is this real,” one of them, an American sky diver named Chris Colwell, messaged back. “Where are you.”

“Free,” she responded. “And I’ll come see you soon.” She added a heart.

Her escape — planned over several years with the help of a Finnish capoeira trainer and a self-proclaimed French ex-spy — lasted less than a week.

Within a few days of setting sail on the Indian Ocean in the Frenchman’s yacht, bound for India and then the United States, the sheikha went silent. She has not been seen since, except in a few photos released in December by her family, which says she is safely home after surviving what they said was a kidnapping.

Yet thanks to the video she made before fleeing, her face and voice have made their way around the world, drawing more than two million views on YouTube, spurring avid news coverage and marring Dubai’s image as a world capital of glitz and commerce.

Like the young women who[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-women-flee.html] have fled Saudi Arabia’s restrictive regime, Sheikha Latifa has made sure no one can forget how few freedoms are allotted to women in the Middle East’s most conservative societies — or how costly crossing Dubai’s ruler can be.

[Video: Watch on YouTube.[http://youtube.com/embed/UN7OEFyNUkQ]]

For all its megamalls, haute cuisine and dizzying skyscrapers, Dubai can flip at speed from international playground to repressive police state. It has drawn headlines in the West for detaining foreigners[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/world/middleeast/dubai-crimes-united-arab-emirates-jail.html] for holding hands in public and drinking alcohol without a license.

Last year, it was widely condemned for holding a British academic[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/world/middleeast/uk-student-matthew-hedges-emirates-spy-released.html], Matthew Hedges, after accusing him of being a British spy. In recent years, the authorities have also intensified a crackdown on internal dissent.

“It doesn’t matter whether you’re an ordinary Emirati citizen or a member of the royal family or an expat from a close ally like the U.K.,” said Hiba Zayadin, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. “If you’re harming that carefully tailored image,” she added, “you will face the consequences.”

Over the video’s 39 stark minutes, her voice composed and forceful, Sheikha Latifa described in fluent English her life of constricting privilege and stunted hopes. She hoped it would change if she could win political asylum in the United States.

“I don’t know how, how I’ll feel, just waking up in the morning and thinking, I can do whatever I want today,” she said. “That’ll be such a new, different feeling. It’ll be amazing.”

Fearing for her life if she was caught, she said she was recording the video in case she failed.

“They’re not going to take me back alive,” she said. “That’s not going to happen. If I don’t make it out alive, at least there’s this video.”

Sheikha Latifa first faced rigid restrictions after her sister’s failed escape attempt years earlier.

When she was 14, her older sister Shamsa escaped[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/dec/15/jamiewilson.stuartmillar1] from her family’s security detail on a trip to England. Her father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, owns a large estate there and a prominent thoroughbred racing stable, Godolphin.

News reports at the time said Emirati personnel eventually tracked Shamsa to a street in Cambridge, forcing her into a car. When a Scotland Yard detective began investigating her case as a kidnapping, Dubai authorities refused to let him interview her. The case dead-ended there.

Sheikha Latifa said Shamsa, the only of 30 siblings to whom she was close, had been drugged into docility ever since.

Horrified by Shamsa’s treatment, Sheikha Latifa said she tried to escape across the border to Oman. Retrieved almost immediately, she said she was held in solitary confinement for more than three years.

Emirati family law allows women to be punished for disobeying, and she said she was frequently pulled out of bed to be beaten, deprived of medical care and, until the final few months, even a toothbrush.

Even after she was released at 19, her life was defined by her family’s constraints as much as by its wealth.

She lived in a palace behind high walls, with 40 rooms spread over four wings — one for each female relative who lived there, said Tiina Jauhiainen, a Finnish woman who had been training Sheikha Latifa in the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira. There were about 100 servants and an athletic compound with its own swimming pool and spa. Wherever the sheikha went, a Filipino maid went too.

But hers was a life of enforced, confined leisure. She could spend her money only on hobbies and sports, including horseback riding and scuba diving, or on treating friends to lunch or manicures. She was not allowed to study medicine as she had wanted, friends said.

Nor could she travel, even to the next-door emirate of Abu Dhabi, one of seven city-states making up the United Arab Emirates. She pressed friends to describe every trip for her “like she was traveling with me,” said Stefania Martinengo, her friend and skydiving coach.

She was also barred from visiting any nonpublic places, even friends’ homes. An avid sky diver, she once parachuted secretly into an unapproved part of the city for 20 minutes of kayaking with Mr. Colwell.

When friends rode along in the boxy black Mercedes that often ferried her around, she put on headphones and sat in silence, refusing, in front of the driver, to say a word.

Skydiving was her chief distraction.

Dropping into the sky, “you’re equal to everyone,” Ms. Martinengo said. “You don’t talk, you’re just flying. I think she enjoyed being free in the sky.”

At first glance, she seemed neither fabulously wealthy nor wildly unhappy.

Introducing herself as Latifa, she was often taken for just another local woman. Under the all-covering abaya she wore in public, she usually dressed in T-shirts and athletic pants. She demurred her way out of most photos. She listened rather than talked. She never outright complained about her situation, friends said.

She never spoke about her family. Dubai’s dazzlingly wealthy flaunted their lives on Instagram; she was barely Googleable.

But she fantasized about running her own life. She talked about starting an Emirati skydiving team, hoping her father would let her travel to international competitions. A vegan who had become passionate about wellness and detox, she planned to invest in a yoga-and-juice center in Europe with Ms. Martinengo.

Almost no one realized that she had been planning to run for several years.

She first contacted Hervé Jaubert, whose website[http://www.escapefromdubai.com/thestory.html] describes him as a former French intelligence officer and “no ordinary man,” who had once managed to escape Dubai in a small rubber boat by dressing as a woman.

She then enlisted Ms. Jauhiainen. At one point, they trained to dive and swim to Oman via underwater scooter.

Ms. Jauhiainen said Sheikha Latifa wanted to help other women who had been trapped in similar situations, and she wanted to get Shamsa out. If necessary, she thought she could work as a skydiving instructor.

“I’m ready to flip burgers or do anything as long as I have my freedom,” she told Ms. Jauhiainen.

A few days before they left, she sneaked out of a mall to record the video at Ms. Jauhiainen’s apartment.

“I’m feeling positive about the future,” she said. “I’m feeling like it’s the start of an adventure. It’s the start of me claiming my life, my freedom, freedom of choice.”

The morning of the escape, Sheikha Latifa was driven to eat breakfast with Ms. Jauhiainen at a restaurant, as she often did. According to Ms. Jauhiainen, they got into her car and made for Oman, where they rode an inflatable raft, then Jet Skis, out to Mr. Jaubert’s yacht. A selfie they took in the car shows Sheikha Latifa grinning behind mirrored sunglasses, elated.

“We’re like Thelma and Louise,” Ms. Jauhiainen joked, referring to the 1991 American film.

“Don’t say that,” Sheikha Latifa protested. “It has a sad ending!”

As they sailed toward India on the evening of March 4, the women were getting ready for bed belowdecks when they heard loud noises. They locked themselves in the bathroom, but it filled with smoke. The only way out was up.

On deck, armed men whom Ms. Jauhiainen identified as Indian and Emirati pushed Mr. Jaubert, Ms. Jauhiainen and the Filipino crewmen to the ground, tying them up and beating them. They told Ms. Jauhiainen to take her last breath. Ms. Jauhiainen saw Sheikha Latifa on the ground, tied up but kicking, screaming that she wanted political asylum in India.

Before long, an Arabic-speaking man boarded. He made it clear, Ms. Jauhiainen said, that he had come to retrieve the sheikha.

“Just shoot me here,” she cried, Ms. Jauhiainen recalled. “Don’t take me back.”

Then she was gone.

Her father, Sheikh Mohammed, did not address her whereabouts until December, when the BBC was about to air a documentary. His office issued a statement[https://twitter.com/UAEEmbassyUK/status/1070702035971043328] saying that she was safe in Dubai, celebrating her 33rd birthday with family “in privacy and peace.” (Ms. Jauhiainen said the sheikha had not chosen to spend her birthday with family in years.)

The statement accused Mr. Jaubert, whom it called a “convicted criminal,” of kidnapping her for a $100 million ransom.

Sheikh Mohammed did not reply to a request for an interview sent to his office. The Emirati embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.

Things have only gotten stranger since.

On Christmas Eve, Dubai released the first public photos of Sheikha Latifa since her disappearance. They showed her sitting with Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who confirmed that she had met the sheikha at her family’s request.

Ms. Robinson said Sheikha Latifa was safe with her family, but said she was receiving psychiatric care, calling her a “troubled young woman” with a “serious medical condition.”

“This is a family matter now,” Ms. Robinson said.

The sheikha’s advocates were taken aback that a respected human rights crusader had seemingly embraced[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/world/middleeast/human-rights-robinson-dubai-princess.html] Dubai’s official line. They disputed that she had a psychiatric condition, apart from any she might have developed because of imprisonment or drugging.

“I know 100 percent for sure that she doesn’t need mental care,” Ms. Martinengo said. “Maybe now, after all these treatments, but not before. How can you think that a person who’s been in prison for nine months wouldn’t seem troubled?”

Friends also found Sheikha Latifa’s appearance in the photos — slightly dazed, her eyes missing the camera — concerning.

With negative attention thickening around her, Ms. Robinson issued a statement saying that she had made her assessment “in good faith and to the best of my ability,” adding that the sheikha’s “vulnerability was apparent.”

By mid-January, a lawyer who had been working with activists left the sheikha’s case without explanation. Several friends still in Dubai said they were too frightened to speak, while Mr. Jaubert abruptly stopped responding to requests to be interviewed for this article.

Sheikha Latifa had little doubt about what would happen to her.

“If you are watching this video, it’s not such a good thing,” she said in her video. “Either I’m dead, or I’m in a very, very, very bad situation.”

Society and community,Dubai,"Aligned with the International Maritime Organization’s 2019 World Maritime Day theme, the 4th annual edition of BBME promotes women in leadership through an uptick of female involvement

Dubai – United Arab Emirates – 6th of February 2019: Breakbulk Middle East, the GCC’s leading breakbulk and project cargo event, is doing its part to actively build up the female maritime landscape. This year’s two-day conference will be held under the patronage of Dr. Abdullah Belhaif Al Nuaimi, the UAE Minister of Infrastructure Development and the Chairman of Federal Transport Authority for Land and Maritime and will feature a variety of industry women in leadership roles. The exhibition which is set to take place on the 11th and 12th of February at the Dubai World Trade Centre, in Dubai, UAE, will move the sector one step closer towards gender equality within the industry.

Speaking on this year’s decision to increase female inclusion, Leslie Meredith, Marketing Director, Breakbulk Events & Media emphasized, Like any session, at every other event from the Breakbulk global portfolio, we are always keen on addressing what is topical; what challenges are facing the industry and a variety of other stimulating discussion points. Due to the complexities of shipping, many issues are topical and gender equality is one of them. Reducing the discrepancy between male and female employees, as it pertains to international maritime, is essential for the development of the sector as the experience and expertise that women can provide, whether it be legal, technical, operational or otherwise, will only help in enhancing the industry as a whole.”

Voicing a similar tone, H.E. Eng. Hessa Al Malek, Executive Director, Maritime Sector, Federal Transport Authority for Land and Maritime clarified, By incorporating a strong presence of maritime women with leadership roles in this year’s event, Breakbulk Middle East is demonstrating great advocacy for the concept of gender equality within the industry. Through this inclusion, they are not only empowering the current generation to continue striving for greatness, but they are also inspiring our future leaders. The readiness of BBME to contribute to enhancing the status of women in the maritime sector is a commendable imitative that should be applauded because through empowering women, thriving economies will be fuelled around the world, growth and development will persevere, and we will all benefit as we strive towards safe, secure, clean and sustainable shipping.”

A paradigm shift with challenging barriers

Familiar with the intricacies of being a female and navigating a male dominated industry to earn respect is Jasamin Fichte, Managing Partner, Fichte & Co Legal and President of WISTA Arabia. Elaborating on shattering barriers she commented, Over the years there has been a gradual shift and the industry has become more accepting of the fact that women are equally capable of industry successes. As a result, doors that once appeared to be bolted shut have been unlocked allowing females in maritime to achieve new heights. For this reoccurring theme to enhance even further, young girls who aspire to join the global maritime force and the ladies who already exist in it today must both gravitate towards consistently obtaining new heights. In doing so, our actions will act as the ultimate portrayal of the benefits we can offer to uplift the industry and the appropriate respect will simultaneously be earned.”

Tina Benjamin-Lea, Logistics Manager at SNC-Lavalin and a member of the Advisory Board at Breakbulk Middle East, commented, Women have always contributed to all aspects of our industry, as Project Logisticians delivering projects in often challenging locations, Shipbrokers fixing cargoes, and Cargo Superintendents and Marine Warranty Surveyors loading cargoes on ever growing scales in ports across the globe. In today’s world, Diversity and Inclusion are key drivers and such women in Logistics and Maritime should play an active role in reshaping industry perceptions. SNC-Lavalin is committed to supporting women across all business sectors and developing local talents in the Middle East that can take the lead in creating a better future for generations to come. Breakbulk Middle East provides a great platform to facilitate discussions on how the industry can encourage more young women to choose a career in Project Logistics and the Maritime sector.”

Specializing in global security solutions, Katherine Yakunchenkova, General Manager, Al Safina Security Group stated, Rapid growth of innovations and new technologies that shape the shipping world, such as usage of blockchain, robotic processing systems, drone deliveries, eco-friendly ships provide the industry possibility for big leap in operation efficiency. Technological changes are accelerating and tech trends will contribute stupendously into economic growth that I find remarkable. Through my career, I have witnessed a transformative power of gender diversity meeting more women represented in the technology fields. Based on the World Economic Forum report, finally we will achieve economic gender parity if progress continues at the current rate. Overcoming the digital gender divide is imperative for our common future to be safer, brighter and fairer.”

Suha Abdulla Obaid, Deputy CEO, Folk Group said, Despite women forming nearly 40% of the global workforce, the amount of women involved in international maritime is only a mere two percent. This number encompasses all aspects of shipping, ranging from primarily seafarers to only a few top-level executives. For that reason, bridging the Maritime’s gender gap is an issue that must be addressed and an initiative that Breakbulk Middle East appears to be taking seriously. Although the industry has become more aware of the benefits that come with reducing the gender imbalance, continuing to promote this concept on the significant channels of exposure is a crucial element to combatting the disparity.”

Society and community,Dubai,"Chandigarh, Feb. 6 -- A Dubai court has awarded the custody of a three-year-old boy to his mother, directing her ex-husband, a native of Haryana's Raipur Rani, to handover the boy to her within a month.

Granting divorce to the couple, the court, in its January 23 order, said if the boy's father, Shahid Hussain, did not comply with the orders by February 23, it would issues his arrest warrants?in line with the UAE laws.

Originally issued in Arabic, the court order translated into English was made available recently.

The boy's mother Naseem Akhtar, who hails from Malerkotla in Punjab, and currently resides in Dubai, has been struggling to regain the custody of her son Ryan since January 2018, when her husband snatched the boy, then two years old, from her in India and fled to Nepal.

The divorce was granted from January 4, 2018, when Naseem last saw her husband and son.

Speaking to HT over the phone, Akhtar that Shahid and her son Ryan were in Nepal, as per records of the immigration authorities.

The Regional Passport Office, Chandigarh, which had suspended Shahid's passport to prevent him from entering or exiting India, has issued alerts to authorities concerned regarding Shahid's possible presence in Nepal.

After marrying him in August 2014, Naseem had joined Shahid in Sharjah, where he used to work then.

In a complaint lodged before the Sangrur police, Naseem had submitted that during their visit to India in January 2018, Shahid took her and her son to Delhi at his friend's apartment, where he assaulted her for six days. On their way back to Malerkotla, Shahid assaulted her again, snatched her breastfeeding son, and fled with their passport and other education documents.

After filing the FIR, Naseem got another passport made and returned to Sharjah, eventually relocating to Dubai.

After this, Shahid travelled to Nepal on February 6 with their son, following which his Indian passport was suspended on February 27. But, he somehow managed to return to UAE on April 1. On checking his immigration status later, Naseem found that as of December 20, both Shahid and her son were in Nepal.

Court order

The Dubai court in its order directed Shahid to pay a lump sum compensation of 10,000 United Arab Emirates dirham (AED), 40,000 AED as rent for Naseem's dwelling, in addition to a one-time payment for her furniture (15,000 AED), along with payment of electricity, water and internet bill in a sum not exceeding 1,000 AED.

The court also ordered an alimony of 6,000 AED for the waiting period's expenses while restoring Naseem's educational documents, etc., to her.

The court also directed Shahid to pay an alimony of 1,500 AED per month and AED 500 every Eid-Ul-Fitr and Eid-Ul-Adha.

Besides, he will have to pay a fosterage remuneration of 5,000 AED per month for her son, in addition to taking a health insurance for him, paying his school fees and related expenses.

Easy escape to Nepal

Naseem said despite a lookout circular against Shahid and impounding of his passport, Shahid had been using the Nepal route to move in and out of India since January 2018, while giving her no details regarding the exact whereabouts of their son ever since.

""My son has a digestion problem, and needs breast milk. He used to hit our son so often during his fits of rage,"" shared a concerned Naseem.

Indian nationals do not require a visa or passport to travel to and from Nepal. In fact, any proof of identity is enough, including a driving licence with photo, a voter ID card, a ration card or even some identity document issued by authorities in Kathmandu. From Kathmandu, they can take a flight to India or can just cross over by road.

Society and community,Dubai,"Dubai Culture and Arts Authority (Dubai Culture), the Emirate’s dedicated entity for culture, arts, and heritage, concluded its Agricultural Environment in the UAE segment, which took place as part of the 9th edition of the Live Our Heritage Festival, one of the longest-running heritage festivals in the UAE.

Recording a remarkable presence at Global Village, the leading multicultural festival park of the Emirate, the Festival introduced visitors to various aspects and features of the UAE’s rich agricultural heritage.

During this, the visitors got a chance to learn and explore the agricultural environment in the UAE, and how it differs, in terms of geographical diversity, across different regions within the country.

The segment was a tribute to the UAE’s agricultural history that remains a testament to the genius of Emiratis, who created traditional crafts and remarkable engineering systems, like building water channels and inventing groundwater extraction methods, to adapt to the harsh environmental conditions.

Themed Treasures of Heritage from Emirati Culture, this year’s Festival was divided into four segments, in order to shed light on the different environments in the UAE: Bedouin, Mountainous, Agricultural and Marine. The next phase of the Festival will take visitors to the world of marine, its history and how it influenced the cultural landscape across the UAE.

Fatima Lootah, Director of Cultural and Heritage Programmes at Dubai Culture, and Head of Live Our Heritage Committee, said: Over the last three months, the Festival succeeded in capturing the attention

of visitors. It was an interactive experience for visitors, who got to learn more about the UAE’s Bedouin culture, mountainous landscapes, agricultural heritage, and next, the marine environment. Our agricultural ecosystem has given birth to traditional customs, many of which are still practiced in the Emirati villages and by the local communities, and for this reason we chose to include it into the Festival.”

Lootah said that the Authority will continue to develop the activities to better portray our heritage, which appeals to the visitors of all nationalities.”

The ancient agricultural villages in the country encompass traditions like farmers’ connection to the land, their interaction with the surroundings and their ability to devise natural tools to earn a living. There are several traditional crafts and industries that find their origin in the historic agricultural environment of the UAE, including: Al Safafa, Al Yazrah, Al Zafana, and Al Midbasa.

The Dubai Heritage Development Centres are playing an active role in the Festival by familiarising visitors with the culture of the country, through a variety of traditional games, which are an integral part of the UAE’s heritage. Using simple tools that promote happiness and strengthen ties, these games bring joy to visitors, underlining the country’s environmental practices.

The Centres are also organising folk performances that celebrate the national history. Other customary practices being highlighted include living art forms like oral traditions, performing arts, ceremonial customs, and the knowledge and skills required to execute the aforesaid.

The Festival welcomes all Global Village visitors, every day, from 5 pm to 10 pm, allowing them to enjoy the colourful program, featured workshops and events that are educating visitors about art and culture across the UAE’s environmental spectrum.

Dubai Culture aims to enhance Dubai’s cultural scene and draw attention to the UAE’s rich heritage. The Authority’s mandate is to build bridges of constructive dialogue between different civilizations and cultures to enhance Dubai's position as a creative and sustainable global city for culture, heritage, arts, and literature, with the aim to empower these sectors by developing creative and innovative projects and initiatives locally, regionally and globally.

Society and community,Dubai,"Affordable housing is set to gain traction in the UAE as property developers shift their focus to this segment by targeting the middle-income population in a bid to double their share in total real estate projects by 2022, experts say.

Latest data show that the UAE is the second-biggest market for affordable housing in the GCC as it requires 98,000 units by 2022 to cater to the needs of the middle-income group, those earning between Dh15,000 to Dh30,000 per month. However, a gap in the market still exists for households earning less than Dh10,000 monthly, offering a huge opportunity to developers to invest in the affordable segment in line with a new housing policy announced by the UAE government to provide better options to residents.

Industry experts said about 63,000 units are likely to be delivered in Dubai this year ahead of Expo 2020, approximately only 12,000 of which will be classified affordable. However, this segment will pick up momentum in the next three years as developers are expanding their development portfolio to cater to the huge demand from middle-income groups.

According to the latest report by Property Finder Group, there is an increasing number of projects dedicated to middle-income classes. However, in the home-ownership market, less than 20 per cent of middle-income projects are affordable to households earning less than Dh15,000 per month.

""Affordable housing allows for continued growth, development and competition, while providing an element of long-term market stability and sustainability,"" said Muhammad BinGhatti, CEO and head of architecture at BinGhatti Holding. Until mid-2014, he said real estate projects were aimed toward the luxury segment. However, there has been a positive shift towards more affordable projects due to strong demand from the growing middle class in the region. ""We know that many residents in Dubai are ultimately renters, but could have the potential to convert to homeowners via affordable projects,"" BinGhatti said, adding that budget-friendly properties provide better investment returns than luxury properties, which are often held as trophy assets. Affordable areas At Dh536 per sqft, International City was by far the cheapest place to buy an apartment in Dubai last year, according to Property Finder Group's report. Dubailand (Dh662) and Dubai Investment Park (Dh690) were the next two most-affordable options, it said, adding that Arabian Ranches has reduced in price by up to 30 per cent last year making it a very affordable option for families. Jumeirah Village Circle at Dh646 a sqft was the most affordable place to buy a villa in Dubai last year as prices fell 11.1 per cent in the area. Green Community (Dh663) and Town Square (Dh738) were the next most affordable options. ""UAE real estate, marked by 2018, has developed a variety of affordable options suitable for almost all budgets. This factor has dramatically increased the competition within the region between the real estate giants and emerging boutique developers,"" said Anna Sheremet, head of sales at Sweid & Sweid. In Abu Dhabi, the report said affordable communities outperformed the more expensive developments last year. Al Ghadeer (Dh794) was the most affordable area to buy an apartment in the capital while Al Reef (Dh805) and Baniyas (Dh913) were the next two most affordable options. For buying a villa in the capital, Hydra Village (Dh468) was the most affordable place. It was followed by Al Reef (Dh650), Al Samha (712) and Al Ghadeer (Dh750). Largest consumer base Atif Rahman, partner and director of Danube Properties, said middle-income households are the largest consumer base in any economy and their well-being depends on the availability of affordable homes. They are the largest economic group that have historically remained out of the freehold real estate market - for a long time, partly due to the lack of affordable home supplies. ""As the real estate market matures, it will rely on the real demand to grow - which can only come from affordable homes segment, while luxury real estate will continue to cater to the minority section of the real estate consumer base. We believe the real demand in the affordable segment is very high - in fact the highest,"" he said. Shaher Mousli, chairman and chief executive officer of Arthur Mackenzy Properties Group, said affordable housing is a significant consideration for the government as well as developers given the high rate of migrants who come here looking for a job, making this country their home and who are a major portion of the overall population. Referring to latest research reports, he said households in Dubai with an income between Dh3,000 and Dh10,000 per month represent almost a quarter of its three million population. ""The percentage is similar in Abu Dhabi and this segment is only growing in both cities. The number of affordable residential units in Dubai and Abu Dhabi should ideally be able to meet this requirement,"" Mousli said. ""We are already seeing and will receive more influx of new residents arriving in to Dubai to take up jobs related to Expo 2020. The migrant population is also expected to only rise, all this will contribute to an increased demand in affordable housing,"" he added. Sofya Shamuzova, founder and CEO of Stars Dome Group and Mall Global, said local reports and stats indicate that a ballpark 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the households in Abu Dhabi as well as Dubai are in the middle-income category and with the country's robust development plans, this number is likely to grow after 2020. It is important to be able to offer such a number of affordable housing units to satisfy the need. ""We try to offer reliable housing solutions to those with monthly salaries that make them eligible for a mortgage, which is around Dh8,000 to Dh15,000 per month. However, the word 'affordable' lacks a set definition in this market hence the range is not set in stone,"" she said. Imran Farooq, CEO of Samana Developers, said there is huge demand and competition for low-cost units in the UAE and developers, especially in Dubai, are weighing up the option between high- and low-end developments. ""For investors, the affordable housing trend is a growing opportunity, which will be dominated in 2019 as we head up to the peak opportunity of Expo 2020,"" he added. In the 9.68 million population of the UAE, he said there are 88,700 millionaires. The remaining 8.79 million include a substantial number of prospect buyers who are currently seriously thinking to buy, instead of living in a rented apartment, he said. Sunil Gomes, CEO of Gemini Property Developers, said the affordable housing segment is set to significantly grow in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi in years to come. ""A massive influx of talent is expected as a result of Expo 2020, with the fair expected to create nearly 277,000 new jobs in the UAE and attract nearly 25 million visitors. These numbers set the tone for a rising demand for affordable and budget properties to cater to the lower and middle-income group among those visiting, taking up temporary jobs or deciding to stay on permanently,"" he said. ""A real estate market's stability rests with 'real demand', i.e. users buying homes. And today there is a definite shift in sentiment among buyers, owing to government reforms and a plateauing of prices, to buy instead of rent. This owner-occupier trend will boost the affordable

Society and community,Dubai,"ABU DHABI, 3rd February, 2019 (WAM) -- To coincide with the historic visits to the UAE by His Holiness Pope Francis and His Eminence the Grand Imam of Al Azhar Al Sherif, a new book celebrating the country’s diversity was launched today.

Published by Dubai-based Motivate Publishing and entitled ‘Celebrating Tolerance: Religious Diversity in the United Arab Emirates’, the book was launched at a ceremony at the British Embassy, hosted by British Ambassador Patrick Moody.

In a Foreword to the book, Sheikh Nahyan says that, ""Because we live so harmoniously together in the United Arab Emirates, we may suspect that our various religions might all value tolerance. This anthology serves the essential purpose of converting our vague suspicion into fact. That wonderful fact of tolerance deserves the celebration accorded by this splendid book. To ensure that the celebration never ends, we must communicate and protect the fact by always acting in the spirit of the fact. Without our active attention, tolerance can swiftly vanish. Let the essays in this book inspire tolerance in perpetuity.""Introducing the event, Moody quoted Britain’s Queen Elizabeth on what she described as the importance of a ""continued focus on patience, friendship, a strong community focus and considering the needs of others.""""As we look for new answers in the modern age,"" he quoted Queen Elizabeth as saying, ""I, for one, prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek out the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture.""He went on to cite a quotation in the book from His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai.

His Highness Sheikh Mohammed, Moody said, had written, ""We need to study, teach and practice tolerance and to instill it in our children, both through education and our own example.""""Tolerance is no catchphrase, but a quality we must cherish and practice .it must be woven into the fabric of our society, to safeguard out future and maintain the progress we have made.""Edited by the Reverend Canon Andrew Thompson, Vicar of St. Andrew’s Anglican Church in Abu Dhabi, ‘Celebrating Tolerance’ is a compendium of the experiences of people from ten various faiths who coexist peacefully in the country. Many are of groups that first arrived in the UAE in the 1960s and 1970s as the country embarked on its programme of rapid development.

Explaining the book, Reverend Thompson, who has also authored ‘Jesus of Arabia’ and ‘Christianity in the UAE’, said that ""The UAE has been home to people from diverse faiths. The book aims at celebrating this diversity and building greater understanding amongst communities on different rituals and customs.""WAM/PH

The choice of the UAE by His Holiness Pope Francis, Head of the Catholic Church, as the first country in the Gulf to which to pay a visit, he said, is proof of its great international position, especially in humanitarian work, as a global centre for human coexistence and tolerance.

In a statement to the Emirates News Agency, WAM, Thanawalla said, ""The UAE is keen to spread the culture of tolerance not only at the local level, but also at the global level through cooperation with the greatest religious figures, such as His Holiness Pope Francis, who is a global religious symbol who plays a leading role in establishing bridges of dialogue and brotherhood between different religions in the world.""""The UAE,"" he added, ""is a perfect example of tolerance, integration and acceptance of the other, and the best example of what the future can be.""Thanawalla went on to recall the statement by the Aga Khan, spiritual leader and 49th Imam of the Ismaili Muslims, at the groundbreaking for the Ismaili Centre in Dubai.

""Let me take this occasion,"" he quoted the Aga Khan as saying, ""to pay tribute to the experience of the Emirates which, like the lesson of Islam's history, illustrates admirably what heights are achievable, in realising human potential, when national interest and Muslim identity are anchored in values – our historical values – that widen intellectual horizons, and help to build bridges of friendship and understanding.""WAM/PH

Society and community,Dubai,"For Ali Al Sayed and Mina Liccione, religious tolerance is more than just an aspiration. It's a way of life.Unusually for a couple in Dubai, theirs is a mixed-faith marriage, with Mina - born a Catholic - choosing not to follow standard practice by converting to Islam when they tied the knot.

She is excited to be on the waiting list for the mass that Pope Francis is expected to hold on Feb 5, during the first ever papal visit to the Arabian Peninsula.

If she gets a ticket, Ali has promised to take over the child-care duties for their 14-month-old twin boys to make it easier for her to attend. “It takes time to understand that every ritual and every habit is personal,” he told Reuters. “So adapting to each other's rituals is really about giving the other person space to do what they need to do.” Living in a Muslim-majority country, Ali has faced pressure for Mina to convert.

“A lot of people ask so when is she going to be Muslim. It's one of those things like, so when are you going to come over to our house.” But he is mindful that even the Prophet Mohammad failed to convert his uncle, so “this is something that I cannot force onto somebody.” He and Mina started off as business partners when they founded Dubomedy, a Dubai-based arts and comedy school, in 2008. She remembers their wedding seven years ago as a fond occasion on which both their cultures came together.

“His family came out with the Khaleeji (Gulf) music, and my family came out with the O Sole Mio, (Luciano) Pavarotti, you know we had a singer singing Arabic songs and an Italian song,” Mina said.

Economic zones,Abu Dhabi,"Dubai’s DP World agreed to acquires takes in two special economic zones in Central Asian Republic of Kazakhstan, the latest in a string of acquisitions by the world’s fourth-biggest port operator as it continues to expand its global footprint.

DP World plans to buy a 51 per cent stake in the Khorgos special economic zone and a 49 per cent shareholding in the Aktau zone, the company said, without specifying the value of the two deals or how it plans to fund them. The two framework agreements signed in Abu Dhabi on Saturday will give DP World management and governance rights of the economic zones, it said.

Kazakhstan is an important link in the New Silk Route and in the development of the Belt and Road Initiative,” said Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the group chairman and chief executive of DP World. Focusing on soft and hard infrastructure development that supports multi-modal transport links will be key in realising its potential.”

DP World has already been providing management services to the Port of Aktau, Kazakhstan’s main cargo and bulk terminal on the Caspian Sea, and Khorgos economic zone, on the China-Kazakhstan border.

The Nasdaq Dubai-listed port operator has been aggressively expanding and strengthening its presence in different regions worldwide. It acquired two new assets in Peru and India earlier this month as it ramped up its investments in the fast growing South Asian and Latin American markets. _______

The company, along with India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), bought a majority stake in an Indian logistics and warehousing firm, as part of $3 billion spending plans. In Peru, the company acquired Cosmos Agencia Maritima, for $315.7 million.

Separately, Austria’s Borealis, a unit of the Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company, and Kazakhstan’s United Chemical Company (UCC) plan to build a major petrochemicals facility integrated with an ethane cracker in the central Asian republic.

The two companies completed the pre-feasibility study on the project and signed a joint development agreement (JDA) in Abu Dhabi, Borealis said on Saturday. The partners also signed a separate government support agreement with Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna for the project.

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was also inked by ministers of energy from the UAE and Kazakhstan to cooperate on a 500 kilo-tonnes per annum polypropylene Samruk-Kazyna-backed project, which is currently under construction. The signing ceremony was also attended by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev.

The Borealis-UCC project now moves into the feasibility study phase, which is expected to run until the first quarter of 2019 after which a local joint venture between the two companies is expected to be formed, the companies said.

This project would significantly strengthen Borealis’ position in the CIS markets …. [with] significant potential for development of advanced PE business based on our Borstar technology,” said Mark Garrett, Borealis chief executive.

The final investment decision on the project is expected to be taken in 2020 and start-up would be scheduled for 2025, the firm added, without specifying the estimated value of the project.

Mubadala owns a 64 per cent direct stake in Austria’s Borealis. OMV, which holds the remaining shares in Borealis, is 25 per cent owned by the Abu Dhabi-based investment company.

Economic zones,Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, 24th March, 2018 (WAM) -- Global trade enabler DP World and the government of Kazakhstan signed two framework agreements in Abu Dhabi today relating to the acquisition, governance and management of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in Aktau and Khorgos.

DP World has been providing management services to the Port of Aktau, Kazakhstan’s main cargo and bulk terminal on the Caspian Sea, and Khorgos SEZ, which is strategically situated on the China-Kazakhstan border and has been acting as the primary transit point for trans-Eurasian cargo trains for more than four years.

DP World now plans to acquire a 51% stake in the Khorgos SEZ and 49% in the Aktau SEZ following the agreements signed today, to play an important role in enhancing trade connectivity along the New Silk Route, handling all cargo types including hydrocarbons, containers and bulk.

The agreements were signed between Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Group Chairman and CEO of DP World and Kanat Alpysbayev, President of Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ) and Yeraly Tugzhanov, Governor of the Mangistau region of Kazakhstan.

Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Group Chairman and CEO, DP World, said: ""Kazakhstan is an important link in the New Silk Route and in the development of the Belt and Road Initiative. Focusing on soft and hard infrastructure development that supports multimodal transport links will be key in realising its potential as a transit corridor as well as boosting its own economy.

""Our experience in 40 countries and across the global supply chain shows that ports and economic zones working together and employing smart technology to integrate processes are key to enabling trade for local businesses and regional economies.""

Economic zones,Dubai,"Special Economic Zones (SEZs) derive their value from a combination of three key drivers: an encouraging regulatory environment that provides the necessary support the industry needs to take root in a new market; an operating environment that ensures both physical infrastructure (hard) and policies (soft) are in place to support businesses and their employees; and the more rudimentary element of incentives, financial and non-financial, that provide impetus for investment in a location that might other-wise be less appealing.

The UAE was a pioneer in harnessing the value of SEZs to attract foreign investment, driving growth in a more diverse range of economic activity with the launch of free zones in 1985. These free zones took advantage of mostly financial and non-financial incentives – which were unique in the region at the time.

However, as the initial growth and investor attraction plateaus out, the focus is increasingly sharpening on deeper value chain integration, where the lion’s share of GVA (gross value added)growth exists. Jebel Ali is a powerful example, with the development of Dubai South, integrating Jebel Ali Sea Port with the new Al Maktoum International Airport, and the provision of production/processing infrastructure to capture a far greater share of GVA than simple logistics alone offers.

The new generation of special economic zones should be measured on their contribution to economic objectives

With the development of such propositions, however, comes the need for a much deeper understanding of the comparative advantages needed for a sector (or even sub-sector) to ensure sustainable success of not just the one industry – but the economic outcomes for the host economy.

In line with much of the new economy”, the traditional hard infrastructure components of SEZ propositions are reducing in relevance; the knowledge economy does not need an abundance of oil or iron ore on its doorstep, or industrialised trade routes through which to ship heavy goods.

As such, soft infrastructure is more important than ever: suitability of the regulatory regime; robust legal infrastructure to support IP rights and overcome business failures; the overall ease of doing business; the strength and consistency of institutions; and a compelling lifestyle proposition, coupled with intelligent incentives packages, are critical to a new SEZ proposition.

In our experience, a crucial aspect closely scrutinised by any potential investor in an SEZ is the governance model. Often, the primary catalysts for the creation of an SEZ are the institutional shortcomings in the host base economy, hence the governance of that zone must offer transparency, efficiency, consistency and security to succeed.

One of the most cited examples of a successful governance model is the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). A material ingredient to its success can be attributed to its governance model (most famously the independent judicial system based on English law) to provide a compelling business environment for such economic activity.

Also, moving away from pure investor attraction or a real estate play, the new generation of SEZs should be measured on their contribution to the host nation’s economic objectives: increased (and diversified) GDP, better quality employment opportunities for citizen populations, and growth in export trade.

Removing barriers

Ultimately, SEZs should be a catalyst or transitional tool towards the integration of economic activity within the base economy itself. In many cases, SEZs act as a safe” pilot or proof of concept for institutional reform that can then be adopted in the host economy, removing the need for such zones and absorbing the full economic value of their activities.

The GCC is well placed to reach the aspirational goal of removing the boundaries between host economy and SEZ – as the soft infrastructure is now increasingly being adopted by the government into the base economy – as witnessed by the new investor visas and ownership laws.

The goal for Gulf countries, then, would be to attract the most innovative investors from across the globe and create advanced economic activity locally through an innovative framework of incentives, regulation and governance.

Economic zones,Dubai,"The United Arab Emirates’ (UAE’s) global port operator Dubai Ports World on March 24 signed two framework agreements to acquire stakes in Kazakhstan’s two Special Economic Zones (SEZs).

The stakes include 51% in the SEZ located on the Kazakh-side of the Kazakh-Chinese Khorgos free trade zone and 49% in Aktau Port’s SEZ. The Khorgos project is a joint effort between Kazakhstan and China to build a logistics and trading hub. It will serve as a dry port as part of China’s huge One Belt One Road (OBOR) trade and transport infrastructure initiative. The stake bought by Dubai Ports is likely the Khorgos-Eastern Gate SEZ, dubbed “New Dubai”.

DP World has been providing management services to Aktau, Kazakhstan's main cargo and bulk terminal on the Caspian Sea, it said.

The port operator seeks to ""play an important role in enhancing trade connectivity along the New Silk Road"" as part of OBOR, according to an emailed statement, cited by China's Xinhua news agency. A big objective of OBOR is turning Central Asian countries into a smooth transit zone for Chinese goods flowing into Europe, and vice versa.

Regulation/government policy: regulatory bodies and deregulation,Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates plans to introduce initial coin offerings (ICOs) next year to provide companies with a fresh way to raise money, the head of the securities regulator said on Monday.

In ICOs, companies issue cryptocurrency tokens to investors, in much the same way as they issue shares in an initial public offer of equity.

“The board of the Emirates Securities & Commodities Authority has approved considering ICOs as securities. As per our plan we should have regulations on the ground in the first half of 2019,” Obaid Saif al-Zaabi told a seminar.

ESCA is drafting regulations for ICOs with international advisers and is working with the Abu Dhabi and Dubai stock markets to develop trading platforms for the offers, he said, adding that details would be announced later.

Weak equity markets coupled with low oil prices in the last several years have severely constrained IPOs in the UAE and the Gulf Arab region as a whole.

A new law may take effect in 2019 to facilitate IPOs in which family owners sell majority or 100 percent stakes in the companies they control, Zaabi said. ""The Ministry of Economy has written to the prime minister’s office and we are awaiting approval.”

Other initiatives under way include having a minimum of 20 percent women on the boards of listed companies, he said. (Reporting by Stanley Carvalho; Editing by Andrew Torchia and Alison Williams)

Regulation/government policy: regulatory bodies and deregulation,Abu Dhabi,"ABU DHABI, 22nd September, 2018 (WAM) -- The Federal Tax Authority, FTA, has invited retailers, outlets and shops registered for Value Added Tax, VAT, to register in the digital system of the Tax Refund Scheme for Tourists, which will come into effect as of the fourth quarter of 2018.

The Authority is implementing the Scheme in cooperation with Planet, and has identified four basic conditions for registering, namely: the retailer must be registered with the Authority for VAT and have a tax registration number, TRN; the supplier’s sales of goods must not be excluded from the refund scheme, as determined by the Authority; the retailer must submit a request to participate in the Scheme as determined by the FTA; and finally, the retailer must meet the financial credit requirements specified by the system operator and be committed to submitting Tax Returns and paying due taxes regularly.

In a press statement issued today, the Federal Tax Authority cautioned that a retailer’s membership in the Tax Refund Scheme for Tourists would be revoked if they fail to meet their obligations, whether those stated in tax laws or in the contract between the system operator and the retailer.

FTA Director-General, Khalid Ali Al Bustani asserted that the past few days witnessed a great demand for registration in the Tax Refund Scheme for Tourists, adding that the Authority continues to organise workshops and seminars – in cooperation with Planet – to introduce retailers already registered for VAT to the simple procedures for registering in the digital system of the Refund Scheme, which is one of the most advanced of its kind in the world.

""The Federal Tax Authority is hosting an extended meeting in collaboration with the system operator on 25th September, bringing together representatives of retail companies and outlets in the Emirate of Ajman in an effort to maintain direct and constant communication with businesses, and introduce them to the terms and conditions for registering in the Tax Refund Scheme for Tourists,"" Al Bustani added, revealing that the FTA intends to hold similar meetings in the Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

""Both meetings achieved remarkable success and great response from businesses in the two emirates; the activities included presentations to explain the Scheme in detail, as well as Q&A sessions to answer queries and concerns raised by representatives of registered businesses,"" Al Bustani continued.

""The Authority has developed a comprehensive plan to introduce the new Scheme and its registration requirements and conditions, including induction programmes offered through the FTA official website, as well as social media, print and audio-visual outlets,"" he added.

Al Bustani noted that the Cabinet Decision No. 41 of 2018, issued on 24th July 2018, outlined a clear set of standards for transparency and accuracy in the procedures to refund VAT to tourists visiting the UAE, and who are not residents in the country. The Tax Refund Scheme for Tourists is in line with international best practice, he asserted, citing the Scheme’s integrated system that enables direct connection to all outlets and shops across the UAE.

""The system operator will coordinate between retailers registered in the tax system and wishing to register for the Scheme, connecting them with ports of entry and exit all around the UAE,"" the FTA Director-General explained. ""This, in turn, allows tourists who are eligible for a tax refund – as per the terms and conditions of the Cabinet Decision – to request a refund for taxes incurred on their purchases through a state-of-the-art digital system.""""Planet will make agreements with retailers to equip them with the technologies needed to be part of the Scheme, which link these business to the digital systems of the Federal Tax Authority, as well as airports and land and sea ports.

Regulation/government policy: regulatory bodies and deregulation,Abu Dhabi,"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the citys de facto central bank, has signed an agreement with a financial regulator in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to boost collaboration on financial technology (fintech) and help innovative companies to expand in each others markets.

HKMA says the deal with the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) is aimed at ""encouraging and enabling innovation in financial services in both markets, and supporting innovative financial businesses in expanding to each other`s jurisdictions.

ADGM is an international financial centre located in Abu Dhabi, the UAEs capital.

""Under the cooperation agreement, the HKMA and the FSRA will collaborate on referring innovative businesses, information sharing, and joint innovation projects,"" HKMA says in a statement on June 26.

The deal was signed in Hong Kong by Nelson Chow, HKMAs chief fintech officer and Richard Teng, chief executive officer of FSRA.

According to Mr. Chow, it will ""strengthen the two authorities in their respective roles and initiatives in fintech"".

""We are particularly pleased to start a dialogue with FSRA on the opportunity to build a cross-border trade finance network using distributed ledger technology (DLT), he says in the statement.

DLT is a digital system for recording transaction of assets. The details are recorded in multiple places over the internet at the same time. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have no central data store or administration functionality.

Mr. Teng describes Hong Kong as a ""long-term strategic and economic partner of Abu Dhabi and the UAE"".

""This cooperation augments ADGMs commitment in supporting the growth and financial developments of Abu Dhabi and the Middle East, Africa and greater Asia regions,"" he says in the statement.

Hong Kong regulators have signed similar partnerships with other foreign counterparts.

Last September, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission inked a fintech agreement with Securities Commission Malaysia to spur greater cooperation in facilitating and regulating innovations in the digital finance industry by encouraging greater information sharing on trends and regulatory developments.

According to Claudia Marcusson, practice head of investment risk and operations at Singapore-based Stradegi Investment Management Consulting, the success of such partnerships depends on several factors, including the maturity of regulators, their intentions, and the strength of their relationships.

She says the tie-ups usually benefit larger fintech firms first.

""This is because the smaller fintech start-ups will just go ahead without waiting for the regulators, and try to navigate within the current regulations,"" Ms. Marcusson tells Asia Asset Management.

Regulation/government policy: regulatory bodies and deregulation,Abu Dhabi,"Abu Dhabi City Municipality has said that it has saved $288 million following the implementation of sustainability standards by the civic body, to various infrastructural projects.

In a statement, the municipality said that the savings were achieved by the implementation of the standards of value engineering and sustainability during the initial design phases of municipal projects. It added that it had started the implementation of sustainability standards on various roads, parks and infrastructural projects in Abu Dhabi city in 2011.

Projects are being designed with special attention being paid to municipal standards including sustainability requirements that have been included in design manuals and specifications, for the construction of roads, infrastructure, parks and recreational facilities across Abu Dhabi, in conjunction with the Abu Dhabi Quality and Conformity Council, it added.

The implementation of sustainability requirements in projects is being verified by ensuring that projects have sustainable engineering designs, the municipality said.

It added that the Municipal Infrastructure and Assets Sector seeks to implement the latest technologies in support of sustainability, with concerned personnel conducting studies and applied research, pilot projects and joint case studies with universities to review and assess new initiatives and technologies.

The objective of these improvement efforts is to update the relevant specifications and standards, along with the relevant inputs, so as to ensure that they are compatible with stipulations set by Abu Dhabi, the civic body explained.

For example, it said that the municipality has used Geosynthetics networks in the design of asphalt pavements of roads and development projects, a practice which has yielded positive construction results such as increasing the design lifespan of paved roads service, from 20 to 30 years, reducing the thickness of asphalt pavements by 20% to 30%, and reducing the cost of asphalt construction by 10% to 20%.

The municipality has also started its project aimed at reusing various road layers in maintenance through recycling cold asphalt at the project site, thus eliminating the issue of using and transporting new materials to site.

Dubai is to launch a company with Careem, the regional rival to Uber, to manage the ride-hailing system for all taxis operating in the Gulf’s commercial hub.

The emirate’s transport authority said on Sunday it would be the world’s first partnership between a government regulator and a private ride-hailing app. Dubai, like other regulatory authorities, has clashed with fast-growing ride-hailing companies challenging the dominance of traditional taxi services.

Dubai-based Careem, valued by bankers at about $2bn in its last fundraising round, said it would have a 49 per cent stake in the joint venture, which would manage e-hailing systems and online payments for almost 11,000 taxis.

The service will launch in April 2019. Dubai taxis, which are owned by the government and major business families in the emirate, will still collect passengers from the streets.

Existing ride-hailing services for about 6,500 limousines in the emirate, which is dominated by Careem and Uber, would continue as normal, the regulator said.

Mattar Al Tayer, director-general of Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority, said the partnership would increase efficiency through better accessibility to vehicles, and would also reduce waiting times.

“The RTA intends to leverage the taxi sector in Dubai,” he said. “E-hail has become the most effective tool for matching supply with demand and offering clients a smooth experience in obtaining taxis.”

Careem said the venture could be expanded to include other transportation services, such as buses, as Dubai seeks to extend its regional leadership in technology innovation of government services.

It will share start-up costs with the RTA and its revenues will be derived from a fixed booking fee per ride.

Careem, which was founded by former McKinsey consultants in 2012, won a tender for the project ahead of four other competitors, including Uber.

Uber, which faces growing regional competition from rivals, had held talks to take over Careem, people aware of the negotiations said in July, but these have since fizzled out. The two groups compete in most big cities in the Middle East, north Africa and Pakistan.

“We remain committed to being a true partner to Dubai for the long term,” said Uber.

Careem’s backers include Chinese ride-hailing group Didi Chuxing, German car manufacturer Daimler and the holding company of global investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who was detained in last year’s anti-corruption crackdown in Saudi Arabia.

Regulation/government policy: regulatory bodies and deregulation,Dubai,"In the past few years, the UAE has made noticeable strides in improving the structure of the healthcare sector by delinking operational institutions from supervisory or regulatory bodies. Such efforts reinforce the overarching role of the Ministry of Health as a legislative, regulatory and preventive authority.

The emirate of Abu Dhabi has led by example in demarcating healthcare management from healthcare regulation by replacing the General Authority of Health Services with two entities – the Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (SEHA), an independent public joint stock company that owns and operates all public hospitals and clinics across Abu Dhabi, as well as the Department of Health that regulates the public and private healthcare sectors.

For its part, Dubai has taken tangible steps too with Law No. 6 and Decrees No. 17 and 18 of 2018, which led to restructuring the internal management of the Dubai Health Authority on par with global standards in terms of organisational units and their roles and specialties.

Policy decisions also mandated the establishment of the Dubai Healthcare Corporation, Dubai Health Insurance Corporation and other allied entities, thereby reengineering public service offerings and DHA’s organisational functions.

The restructuring efforts have proven vital not just in increasing efficiency but also towards reducing costs, size, units, departments and levels in the restructured institution, and improving competitiveness overall.

The health industry is facing considerable challenges worldwide in terms of accommodating the rapid changes in medical sciences and technologies

Drawing lines

The concept of delinking operational and regulatory functions is not specific to the UAE alone, and has been endorsed by global health systems. In recent years, countries of the GCC region have tended to separate government hospitals from the Ministry of Health, and set up independent bodies to overcome administrative problems and adopt ways to provide greater autonomy to healthcare facilities. This demarcation provides operational institutions with independence to form partnerships, sell assets or hand over their management to a private company to further drive and develop government synergies and relationships with the private sector.

At Dubai Science Park, we have been witnessing these transformations in healthcare operations that are aligned with the Dubai Industrial Strategy 2030, with much interest.

As a destination that focuses on exploring investment ideas, introducing investors to new opportunities, providing the facilities they need, and communicating with decision makers to inform them of investors’ needs, Dubai Science Park is keenly receptive to all medical and scientific developments that take place in the country and their implications for the sector at large in this region and beyond.

Today, the health industry is facing considerable challenges worldwide in terms of accommodating the rapid changes in medical sciences and technologies, the advancements in prevention, diagnosis and treatment methods, as well as the tremendous and continuous surge in information, data and communication networks that disrupt the status quo from one minute to the next, and will continue to disrupt.

Restructuring the health industry is a significant first step in building a best-in-class healthcare hub

Making health pay

Closer home in Dubai, the importance of the healthcare industry cannot be emphasised enough – as it also plays a crucial role in diversifying the economy away from oil. The Dubai Health Strategy 2016-2021 aims to make the emirate a leading healthcare destination through adopting innovative and integrated healthcare models, implementing accountability principles and standards through an innovative framework for governing the health sector, and enhancing public-private sector partnerships in regulating, offering and sustaining health services.

These administrative changes can lead to the sector’s overall advancement. However, if we are to transform Dubai into a global healthcare hub, greater engagement from the private sector can play a pivotal role in increasing investments in R&D.

Creating an ecosystem that feeds innovation through an advanced infrastructure, expanded networks, and an enabling regulatory framework will also help establish Dubai’s position as a destination for innovative businesses seeking a suitable environment to launch into neighboring markets. This in turn, can only be achieved by attracting reputable global health institutions and experts to offer treatment solutions and supportive smart technologies.

Given what is at stake, the restructuring of the health industry is a significant first step in building a best-in-class healthcare hub comparable to developed nations around the world.

Marwan Abdulaziz Janahi is also the Chairing Member of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Equipment Taskforce within the Dubai Industrial Strategy 2030.

Growing sector

Dubai Health Authority (DHA) has published a new guide for investors as it seeks to increase private sector investment over the next few years. The Dubai Health Investment Guide 2018-25 comes as Dubai leads the way for private sector participation in healthcare in the Middle East and North Africa region.

Private sector healthcare providers in Dubai have contributed to developing a strong health ecosystem, and account for over 79 percent of outpatient services, and over 74 percent of inpatient services.

Increase in demand for quality health services due to Dubai’s rapid urban development, population growth and influx of medical tourists is one of biggest challenges facing the Dubai Health Authority.

Regulation/government policy: regulatory bodies and deregulation,Dubai,"A scheme to digitally track all cigarette products to guarantee compliance with excise tax requirements in the UAE will be launched on January 1, 2019.

Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Minister of Finance and Chairman of the Federal Tax Authority (FTA), issued a decision regarding the implementation of the Marking Tobacco and Tobacco Products Scheme.

The decision stated that the scheme will go into effect on January 1, 2019, affecting all types of cigarettes sold locally - whether imported or locally produced - with plans to gradually expand the scheme to include all tobacco products. They will be digitally tracked, from production until they reach the end-consumer. This will help comply with excise tax requirements on tobacco products.

The FTA stressed the need for tobacco suppliers to abide by the scheme in order to avoid penalties, which could include being banned from trading until full compliance is achieved.

Marks will be placed on the packaging of tobacco products and registered in the FTA’s database; they contain data that can be read using special devices.

As of January 1, 2019, the marks will be made available for importers or producers of designated excise goods, including cigarettes, to purchase and place on their products, indicating that due taxes have been settled.

As of May 1, 2019, it will not be permissible to import designated excise goods which do not have marks into the UAE. As of August 1, 2019, it will not be permissible to supply designated excise goods which do not have marks in the UAE.

Regulation/government policy: regulatory bodies and deregulation,Dubai,"In light of the recent drop in global oil prices, the economic team on Thursday decided to recommend to President Duterte to push through with the second tranche of oil excise tax hike as mandated under the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Act.

But it will be ultimately up to the President, who this month issued a memo approving the economic managers' earlier recommendation to temporarily suspend the levy, to decide on the matter when the Cabinet meets on Dec. 4, Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III told a press conference Thursday.

Following the meeting of the Cabinet-level, interagency Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC), Dominguez said ""the recommendation comes in light of the favorable outlook in world oil prices, where the Dubai crude oil prices have gone down by 14 percent from an average of $79 per barrel in October down to $68 per barrel so far in November. More so, the oil futures market projects the price of oil to decline further to below $60 per barrel in 2019, indicating a downward trend in world oil prices.""

""The DBCC also took into consideration the adverse impact on revenues and expenditures for fiscal year 2019 should the government proceed with the suspension of the scheduled increase of excise taxes on petroleum. The said measure is estimated to result in a net revenue loss of P43.4 billion for a 12-month suspension, assuming Dubai crude oil prices average $65 per barrel in 2019. The erosion in revenue will lead to a commensurate decrease in government expenditures so as not to breach the target deficit level of 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019,"" the Finance chief said.

""Together with other measures to increase food supply in the country, particularly rice, the suspension of the second tranche of excise taxes on petroleum was intended to curb inflationary pressure and relieve the Filipino people of the high prices of goods. With month-on-month inflation moderating due to supply-side reforms initiated by the government, coupled with falling petroleum prices in the world market, the DBCC deems the suspension unnecessary,"" he added.

The DBCC now expects Dubai crude oil prices to drop to $60-75 a barrel next year, down from the previous assumption of $75-85 a barrel.

Budget Secretary Benjamin E. Diokno said that based on the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' (BSP) computation, inflation would be within the target range of 2-4 percent next year even with the second tranche of fuel excise tax increase.

Under the TRAIN law, an excise tax of P2.50 a liter was slapped on diesel and bunker fuel starting this year. This would go up to P4.50 in 2019, and P6 in 2020.

The excise tax on gasoline also increased from P4.35 a liter to P7 in 2018, and then to P9 next year, and P10 in 2020.

Dominguez said the earlier recommendation to suspend the scheduled oil excise tax increase was ""based on circumstances at that time,"" when global prices shot up in October.

The Finance chief said the economic team ""will be doing the President a disservice"" if they did not bring the recent developments to his attention.

""This is not a rushed decision---this is based on what the facts are today,"" he added.

Regulation/government policy: regulatory bodies and deregulation,Dubai,"The government is set to suspend the excise taxes on fuels in case global oil prices average above $80 a barrel for three straight months.

An interagency committee would issue in the next few weeks the guidelines on the suspension in case a provision in the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Act is triggered.

The law provides: ""For the period covering 2018 to 2020, the scheduled increase in the excise tax on fuel as imposed in this section shall be suspended when the average Dubai crude oil price based on Mean of Platts Singapore for three months prior to the scheduled increase of the month reaches or exceeds $80 per barrel.""

The Dubai crude, the bellwether for Asia, has already reached $77.22 per barrel after dipping to $45.89 in July 2017.

Finance Undersecretary Karl Kendrick T. Chua told reporters that a temporary suspension could result in P40 billion in foregone revenues next year, taking into account higher tax rates supposed to take effect in 2019. He said, however, the value-added tax (VAT) collected from oil products might offset the effect of this move.

He said the guidelines would also dictate when the government could resume collecting the excise tax.

""Some people think the suspension will stop the excise taxes forever, but that's not what it means,"" he added.

Regulation/government policy: regulatory bodies and deregulation,Dubai,"The CEO of Dubai’s property regulator warned developers to deliver on what they promise and maintain the trust that the market has built.

Speaking at the Cityscape Global conference, Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, CEO of the Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA) - the regulatory arm of Dubai Land Department - said while the trust is back in Dubai’s property market, developers who fail to deliver promises on projects risk ruining the faith shown by investors.

My message to the developer: always deliver what you promise, because trust is there in the market; we don’t want to spoil the trust,” Ghalita told the packed audience at InterContinental Dubai in Festival City.

Whatever you promised, you always need to deliver it. We as a government regulator are always watching that, but the first line of defence is you. As a developer, always deliver what you promise.”

He extended the warning to real estate agents, saying they should give investors more information than they require when selling a property.

Real estate agent: you should educate them (investors) this time,” he said.

Flood them with the information they require, even more than what they require, because you are a consultant, and not just a broker that wants to finish the deal. The real estate market is here to sustain; it’s not just about closing one deal, getting the commission and flying away.”

Protect the trust

Ghalita said RERA’s job is to protect the investors, whcih helps build confidence in investing in Dubai’s property market, and creates a positive sentiment for others to buy.

We as a government have a responsibility to protect the investors’ money in off-plan sales, and this is what we’re doing by changing the rules and regulations based on the market conditions,” he said.

Most of you know that nowadays we don’t accept less than 50 percent deposit in the escrow account before we start releasing the money for the developer, and in some projects we raise it to 70 percent. This is our job, to make sure that the investor money is secure and protected.”

Oversupply

Addressing ongoing concerns about oversupply, Ghalita said this was in the hands of the developers who launch new projects.

If we come to the opportunities that the real estate market is giving, everybody will be worrying about price, [and] oversupply, but at the end of the day there is always an economic cycle for everything and this industry lays in the hands of the developer themselves - whatever they want to offer to the investor at the end of the day,” he said.

So managing supply, from my perspective is, as a government [regulator] we put rules and regulations and services in place, making sure that the investor is safe in terms of his investment. But how much supply is in the market, it depends on the developers.”

Healthy market

Ghalita said Dubai's property market is in a good place and will contiue to thrive, pointing to the recent announcement of a record UAE Federal budget for the next three years as a stimulus for the economy. He also referred to the recent statistics released by the Land Department that detailed the number of new investors in Dubai’s property market.

This (Federal budget) has an impact – people are still investing and buying. The Land Department numbers show that there is 9,500 new investors in the last eight months – equivalent to the AED19 billion ($5bn) – 6,500 male, 3,000 female. All of this comes from the trust in the industry itself,”he said

Cheaper than a luxury car

RERA is talking to banks to make it easier for people to get on the property ladder, and Ghalita said banks should be more cooperative in this sense, and should give more solutions, which they are doing”.

On the other hand, the developers are being creative in financing their product. Most of the announcements and advertisements you see in the market, they go up to a ten-year payment plan,” he said.

I keep telling them, to buy a property in Dubai is cheaper than buying a luxury car because of the payment plans, but in terms of assets, it has more value than a car. I think the developer is finding new ways of financing their projects by giving waivers for service charges, fees, and [offering] payment plans after competition.”

Regulation/government policy: regulatory bodies and deregulation,Dubai,"Indenting agents of foreign clients have filed a slew of writ petitions in the Gujarat High Court challenging the applicability of 18% IGST on export services. Thousands of middlemen play an important role in the export and import of goods, especially raw materials in key industries.Due to certain provisions in the current GST law indenting agents have to pay tax on services rendered in India but if they open an office in Dubai, Hong Kong or Sri Lanka, they are exempted.The agents exporting services and earning foreign exchange feel they are being penalised for qualifying as “intermediary” under Section 2(13) of the CGST Act.

The petitioners have challenged the constitutional validity of Section 13(8) (b) of the IGST Act, which deems the place of supply for “intermediary” services to be in India.The indenting agents also stand to lose against other services providers who export services outside India without paying taxes and claiming benefit of ITC refunds at the same time.“There were people who have opened dummy companies in Dubai even when all their services were being rendered out of India. They just had someone in Dubai who would collect the money,” said an ex-customs officer.Indenting agents in other countries are not taxed. An 18% cut on an Indian player's margin not only destroys competitiveness in the international market but also makes it impossible for them to do business in India. Many such agents are shifting base to more favourable jurisdictions. Multiple representations have been filed by intermediaries to remove the said provisions from the GST but the government and the GST Council seem to have ignored these recommendations.
